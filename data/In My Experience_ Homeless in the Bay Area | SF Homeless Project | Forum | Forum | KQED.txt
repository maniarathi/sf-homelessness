A homeless encampment in San Francisco's Mission District.	

Over 6,600 people are homeless in San Francisco, according to a 2015
count by the city. That includes not just people living on the streets,
but those residing in shelters, cars, and other temporary locations. As
part of Forum’s “In My Experience” series, and as part of the SF
Homeless Project media collaboration, homeless Bay Area residents take
us inside their day-to-day lives and share some of the personal stories
behind the statistics.

      Interview Highlights

*On Moving Somewhere More Affordable*

“We tried to get out of San Francisco. I would love to get out of San
Francisco. But outside of San Francisco, the places are starting to get
expensive too. Because they know people are trying to leave San
Francisco to find affordable housing, so for them to make money they’re
raising their prices.” — Pastor Elaine Amos

*On the Stress of Being Homeless*

“Are we going to wake up in the morning? Are we going to get shot
through our tent for being homeless? Are we going to wake up in the
morning and have to move our stuff? It’s very, very stressful every
single day, every minute being out there.” — Jackie Juarez

“I cry every night. It stresses me. I deal with a lot of pregnant girls
and I cry to see them out there and to see people getting killed, the
homeless dying. I talk with them constantly and it’s overwhelming. I cry
myself to sleep wishing there was just something that would fall out of
the sky where I could just help everyone.” — Pastor Elaine Amos

*On What Services Should be Provided*

“Psychological services and the opportunity to be able to make money,
and if they could somehow lend money to get a deposit down on an
apartment.” — Mark

“They definitely need more transitional housing, for youth, coming
basically out of the system or foster care or whatever the situation is.
They hit 18 and basically the only option they have is homelessness.” —
Harmonie Taylor

“When they come out and try to get you to move, have a solution, a place
for you to go.” — Jackie Juarez

*On Police and City Officials*

“Being homeless with the police was horrible, it was very, very
horrible. I would have nightmares worrying about the police, about
taking my things. They would come hit on your tent.” — Pastor Elaine Amos

“It was DPW. Them and the San Francisco Police Department had taken
everything we own… from our medications to our clothes to our cooking,
our food. Everything. We were left with nothing. … An officer the next
morning, after they came and realized we had slept on the street, with
no covers, no blanket, nothing, an officer did give us $20 and told us
to get something to eat.” — Jackie Juarez

*On Talking to Kids About Homelessness:*

“Yesterday, there were five little boys and they were staring at us and
their mom told them, ‘Don’t look at them, they’re homeless; don’t talk
to them.’ And I spoke up and told them, ‘Yes, I am homeless, but we will
not hurt you.’ And the little boy started talking to me, asking me how I
ate and how I did it, and I started showing them my stove, little things
that I do.” — Jackie Juarez

“Let them know we’re people too. We have children too.” — Pastor Elaine Amos

*On What People Should Know About Homelessness*

“You don’t have to look a certain way or be a certain age or be on drugs
to be homeless. Homelessness can happen to anyone.” — Harmonie Taylor

“They need to come out and see what’s really going on, instead of
sitting in their big glass houses and labeling us all as drug addicts.
Come out there and spend time with us, really talk to us, see what’s
going on, see the kind of hardship we’re having. Stop trying to put us
down, because you never know. You can have all this one day and anything
can happen where you can lose it all. It will be gone and you will be
right down there with us and we will be the people who are going to help
you.” — Pastor Elaine Amos
