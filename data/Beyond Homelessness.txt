The San Francisco Chronicle has joined with more than 70 other news
organizations to focus attention on the seemingly intractable problem of
homelessness in our region. The SF Homeless Project explores possible
solutions that might ease, if not end, the suffering of thousands of
people living on our streets, and improve the quality of life for all
residents. Project participants, which began publishing in June, will
continue the work throughout 2016. To date, the SF Homeless Project has
been emulated in more than a dozen U.S. cities where homelessness
remains a humanitarian crisis.
