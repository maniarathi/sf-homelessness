  S.F. Media In Homeless Focus

July 2016

In this issue of the Marina Times, you will find a number of articles
and columns addressing the homeless problem in San Francisco. This paper
is an active participant in a coalition of more than 70 media and civic
organizations that are producing stories on the topic of homelessness —
its severity, costs, and possible solutions.

This is not the first time that the Marina Times has covered
homelessness. Just in the past year we have interviewed Sam Dodge, head
of the mayor’s office dealing with this issue; looked at initiatives to
change the way we treat mental illness among the homeless population;
explored how to inform your children about this problem; reported on
various legislative and real estate regulatory changes that are trying
to alleviate homelessness; and more.

Regardless of the outcome of this journalistic coalition, it will not be
the last time we cover this topic.
