People at a recent gathering in San Francisco
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/related-entities/?eid=48265&ename=San%20Francisco&lang=en>’s
Bayview District
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/related-entities/?eid=4116330694&ename=Bayview%20district&lang=en>
bandied about possible solutions to homelessness, among them a
guaranteed income and stronger tenant protections.

But the folks who proffered these ideas weren’t the usual policy wonks,
media pundits or tweedy academics who typically and freely espouse their
opinions. Rather, they were currently and formerly homeless people at
Project Homeless Connect waiting for services at the neighborhood YMCA.

*RELATED: COMPLETE SF EXAMINER HOMELESS COVERAGE
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/will-sf-see-writing-walls/>
*

The San Francisco Examiner visited the project’s bimonthly service fair
on June 10 as part of multimedia coverage of The City’s homelessness
crisis. The paper joined some 70 Bay Area news organizations in an
effort to study how this problem persists amid a sea of affluence in one
of the world’s leading economies.

Last month, Courtney Martin of the Solutions Journalism Network told The
New York Times that people want to read about “how to fix broken systems.”

In that spirit, the Examiner queried about a dozen Project Homeless
Connect clients — who are informed by their own life experiences — how
that could be accomplished.

Peter, a 59-year-old man who declined to give his last name, was having
lunch at the Project Homeless Connect event after seeking legal aid to
resolve a problem with his bank. A one-time photographer at National
Geographic, Peter also worked as an English teacher while travelling
through Asia.

After he was robbed and his bank account drained, Peter went to the Bay
Area hoping for his friends’ assistance, but they moved out.

To recover his photographic portfolio and resume his career, Peter set
up a profile on HandUp.org. His job history also included stints as a
bartender and graphic designer, but finding work is harder now than he
ever remembered.

“Getting employment is super difficult,” he said. “I don’t know what’s
keeping me from being hired.”

Even if Peter secures employment, the overheated housing market poses
another obstacle. A solution to homelessness, he said, is definitely
housing-related.

“Simple answer: Rent control,” he said. “It’s beneficial for San
Francisco to put a ceiling on this cycle of greed.” Peter also suggested
that housing organizations provide assistance for rental deposits, thus
maintaining housing stability for renters.

Beth Johnson, 48, was an in-support service worker before she spent two
years homeless.

Housed since 2014, she filled out paperwork for the visiting dental
clinic at Project Homeless Connect. When asked about possible solutions
to homelessness, Johnson noted worldwide economic disparity and
suggested a shift in spending priorities.

“It seems to me with all the money on defense, why can’t we spend it all
on people who are hungry?” she said.

A universal basic income would keep people in the U.S. housed and fed,
she said. Under such a system, government or other public entities would
guarantee an unconditional sum of money to its country’s residents, as
well as income received elsewhere. Since 2008, basic income initiatives
were submitted to governments in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. Also, a
recent European Union poll showed that almost two-thirds of EU residents
favored such a plan.
