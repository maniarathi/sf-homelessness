Humanizing homelessness in San Francisco. One story at a time. Soon to
be published in a book.
Jun 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  “I’m not homeless, I’m on my home. The earth is our home.” Gypsy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m from Vermont. One of my friends owned a house there. A bunch of us
lived there, and we all kinda did whatever we wanted, together. We had
potlucks every other week. We turned the house into all of our space. We
had one room, the office, that we painted. Every inch of every wall was
painted. That’s where we started to experiment with psychedelics. Yeah,
I partied, we all did. We lived hard lives in our twenties. My friends
have fallen off buildings or you know, had accidents and died you know,
it’s like, I’m pretty, I’m pretty blessed to make it this far. I’m
pretty blessed I found art.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      “I mean we can go to the fucking moon, but we can’t figure out how
      not to totally poison our environment?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

School wasn’t for me, you know what I mean? Unfortunately, I feel like
schools are built to kill one’s spirit. I was like, I don’t really wanna
work a job for the rest of my life. I want to do something creative.
Dennis is my real name, but Gypsy is sorta, uh, it’s like I reinvented
myself.

Living outside started, I guess, at Lake Champlain, back in Vermont. I
lived out there for a summer. It was great, you know what I mean?
Working when I needed to and just living on this earth. That couldn’t
really last, though, it’s just too damn cold there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been outside here in the Bay for about 5 years. Let me tell you,
California isn’t like anywhere else, not even close. It ain’t perfect,
but at least there are people out here who actually care about what
we’re doing to the planet. People take it for granted, like nothing’s
gonna happen with all the toxins we’re feeding the world. It’s plastic.
It’s in us all, in every mother’s breast milk. I’m really worried for
future generations.

My art, kind of, just comes to me. I think about it, obviously, but
mostly it’s about how it all makes me feel. I can’t really say much
other than when it works, you know it.


      “I was like, man, I don’t really wanna work a job for the rest of
      my life, I need to do something creative.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I try sell it, yeah, or trade it for a BART* ticket or some art
supplies. I have a couple people who keep coming back and buying it. One
lady says she has a storage unit full of my work, but I heard that’s
gone. Really, I don’t care. I’m very unattached, for the most part, to
anything. Object-wise. If someone comes up and loves something I made,
but they don’t have any money, I just say, “take it.” I can tell that
it’s more important to them than it is to me, now, and that’s what I’m
trying to do with it.


      “I’m very unattached, for the most part, to anything. Object-wise.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m starting to do more collage work, but most of my art is assemblage.
You know, sculpture? I find things from all over. Cheap things at
Goodwill, or just things I find at the beach. I like taking the things
that people have thrown out, that they deem useless, and show them what
they’re missing. It makes the work more meaningful, I think. I mean, I
feel like all my assemblage stuff tells a story, cuz it’s all little
pieces of all of our history, you know what I mean?
