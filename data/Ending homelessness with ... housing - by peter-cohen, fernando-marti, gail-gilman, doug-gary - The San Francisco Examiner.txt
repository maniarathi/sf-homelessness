Homelessness
To really address homelessness, The City needs to double the amount of
housing available to homeless people in San Francisco by building new
affordable units for very low-income residents with on-site supportive
services. (Jessica Christian/S.F. Examiner)

The first step of any plan to end homelessness needs to be keeping San
Franciscans housed. As study after study has shown, it is primarily San
Franciscans that make up the people who experience homelessness in our
city — not people who have come here from other places, but people who
had homes here and lost them — due to a variety of reasons, including
the increasing rash of evictions. We need to begin by ensuring that
folks stay in their rent-controlled housing whenever possible and are
quickly rehoused when displacement can’t be prevented. Part of this
includes funding rapid-rehousing opportunities.

But for many who do end up living in their cars or on the streets, the
route out of homelessness is through — you guessed it — housing! From a
fiscal perspective, we know that it is far less expensive to house
homeless people than to keep them homeless, as we spend more on health
care, social services and criminal justice while someone is homeless
than we do on housing for them. For every $1 spent on housing for
homeless adults living with mental illness, there is a $2.50 reduction
in other government spending.

Currently, we have housing for about 6,000 homeless people: About half
of that housing is in residential hotels with light services and that
are master leased; the other half is in nonprofit owned supportive
housing, permanently affordable units that come with services to help
stabilize and support residents like employment programs, youth and
family programs and individual case management. 

To really address homelessness, we need to double the amount of housing
available to homeless people in San Francisco. This means building new
affordable units for very low-income residents with on-site supportive
services, creating permanent community-owned assets. Doing this will
take a sustainable revenue source, and while we need to make sure the
federal and state governments do their part, we also cannot wait for
them to act. It’s up to The City to take real leadership and change the
current trajectory of homeless housing funding and policy in San
Francisco.  

In the last few years, our city’s housing production for extremely
low-income people has shifted toward master leasing. We currently invest
less then 3 percent of The City’s budget toward this issue. We should be
investing more. In the current housing pipeline through 2022, we are
only going to have 632 new units for homeless people — compared to the
almost 3,000 units for homeless people that we built between 2008 and
2014. Since 2014, The City has capped the number of homeless units at 20
percent of all affordable housing and stopped producing buildings that
are 100 percent supportive housing.

This is a misstep and represents a major shift in our city’s housing
policies. In the last few years, The City’s approach has shifted to
simply require that new affordable housing family and senior buildings
set aside 20 percent of units for formerly homeless individuals. While
this policy has resulted in a broader mix of incomes in our affordable
buildings and works well for many residents, it does not replace the
need for providing supportive housing buildings with 24-hour desk clerks
and the kinds of on-site wraparound services so critical for people who
have been chronically homeless or have dual or multiple diagnosis.  

There are currently no projects in the works for 100
percent supportive housing. If The City is truly committed to addressing
the homelessness issue, and housing both families and single adults
experiencing homelessness, then they need to invest in nonprofit-owned
supportive housing. The Mayor’s Office of Housing needs to reconsider
its priorities and immediately start planning for the release of new
funds or requests for proposals for supportive housing buildings on a
regular schedule over the coming years. As part of its continuum of
affordable housing solutions, The City needs to pay as much attention to
the building and renovation of 100 percent supportive housing for our
most vulnerable San Franciscans as they do to other important kinds of
affordable housing. 

Folks working on these issues know what the solutions are. What we are
lacking is political will.
