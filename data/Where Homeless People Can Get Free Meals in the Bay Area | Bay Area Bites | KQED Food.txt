There are about 7,500 homeless people living in San Francisco, and a
larger number in the greater Bay Area. With rising housing and living
costs, it’s not getting easier for people living on the street.

Fortunately, there are also lots of local organizations providing
services to those in need. We’ve compiled a list of many of the places,
sorted roughly by geography, that provide regular hot and fresh meals.
This list primarily focuses on the organizations and services that
provide multiple hot meals each week or daily meal service. There are
/many/ more places that provide a weekly or monthly meal, as well as
food banks that distribute groceries and fresh food. Project Homeless
Connect <https://www.projecthomelessconnect.org/> has a fairly
comprehensive listing of homeless services if you’re looking for more
information, and the independent county food banks are valuable
resources for fresh food pick-ups. If we missed an organization that
provides a place for homeless residents to get a regular hot meal,
please let us know in the comments below.

Most of these organizations are also in need of volunteers and/or
donations. Contact them directly to sign up or to inquire about what
they specifically are looking for.
