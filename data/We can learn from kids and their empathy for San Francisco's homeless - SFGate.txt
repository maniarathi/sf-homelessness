We can learn from kids and their empathy for San Francisco's homeless
1 / 31
Back to Gallery

My 13-year-old daughter recently told me that she never eats her Sun
Chips, even though they're the favorite thing in her lunch, and passes
them out to a homeless person on her walk from school to Muni.

My daughter also dedicated a class project to designing a prototype for
a wooden hut that would be placed on city sidewalks and stocked with
everything from tooth brushes and tampons to socks and blankets that
anyone in need could freely use.

My kids are continuously surprising me with the remarkable empathy they
have for people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco. Again and
again, they say things and do small acts of kindness that make me see
things from a different perspective.

    <http://seasonofsharing.org/?cmpid=712016>

Earlier this year, when I approached a family asking for money in front
of the Noe Valley Whole Foods to find out if they had shelter (and,
let's be honest, a story I could write up for SFGate), my 11-year-old
son pulled a $20 bill from his pocket and handed it to the mother. It
was the money his grandmother had given to him for Valentine's Day and
he'd planned to spend on a comic book.

While adults often ignore the homeless, kids' curiosity leads them to
look at people and see them. An inebriated man in a door stoop isn't
invisible to a child as he might be to an adult who's fed up with the
people sleeping on the streets. Kids care, like really care, and when
they see a person in need, alarm bells go off in their heads and a
feeling of compassion fills their hearts, and they want to do something.

And it's not only my kids who've led me to realize this.

San Francisco resident Sylvia Fu said she saw this happen outside a
movie theater: "There was a homeless woman asking for money and a kid —
probably around 12 years old, walked by and heard her, then turned
around immediately, reached into his pocket and took out some money and
gave it to her — without even thinking twice about it . . . He was with
his friends on a field trip, I believe."

San Francisco mom Andrea Hartsough told me her eldest child asked for
people to bring her checks to Glide Church instead of gifts to her 11th
birthday party.

"She's sensitive to the plight of homelessness," Hartsough shared in an
email. "On our daily commute to school, we take the Duboce/Mission exit.
 Whenever she can, she will take food from her lunch and pass it out the
window to the homeless person working the ramp IF their sign asks for
food or 'anything will help.'" 

And Cornelia Sullivan of S.F. told me this story: "We were baking
cookies one evening and my triplets said, 'Can we give some to the
homeless man by our school?' We gave it to him the next morning. The man
was so grateful and touched that he reached into his pocket and pulled
out a dollar. They said, 'Keep it. We wanted to do this to make you
smile.' I cried!"

Finally, another anecdote. S.F. Mom Cherlynne Rogers told me that she
and her 7-year-old daughter purchased a bag of groceries from a man
selling the Street Sheet at the Good Life Grocery on Tuesday night.

"He peered inside and said 'Wow!'" Rogers wrote in an email. "When I
said 'Look close and there is a $20 too,' he said 'It is like my
birthday! Thank you! Can I give you a hug?' I said yes."

On June 29, media outlets are teaming up to shine a spotlight on the
city’s homelessness problem. Since adults are struggling to find
answers, SF GATE asked local kids for some perspective.

Media: hearst_newspapers

I recently spoke with a group of middle schoolers in the city about this
issue and they all couldn't understand why housing isn't just provided
for everyone. "Just a small home a place to sleep and cook. It makes
someone feel a lot better about themselves," a 14-year-old named Henry
profoundly said to me.

In fact, schools all over the city have stories of students who've
raised money and volunteered hours to help the city's neediest. A
12-year-old named Ethan Klosseck told me he and a classmate designed a
model for a tiny house on wheels that could provide an efficient,
mobile, low-cost housing option. "I think all people should have
equality for basic needs. It's a life standard," said Ethan, who plans
to bring his vision to life with a full-scale version of the house this
summer.

***

These kids' instincts to treat each and every person with dignity is
refreshing and inspiring. Over the years, many S.F. locals, including
myself, have become jaded, hardened, frustrated by the people living on
the streets, dirtying the sidewalks, bothering the tourists. We march
right past people who are clearly in need, and avoid looking because it
makes us feel awful. Sometimes we even cross to the other side of the
street out of fear.

A couple months ago, my son was playing a violin gig for a party in the
outer Mission District benefitting an arts program for San Francisco youth.

We ended up staying late, and as we walked through a dimly lit, empty
street to our car, I was nervous because I remembered parking the car
next to a homeless encampment.

As we approached the vehicle, and I saw the glow of lighters coming from
a group of people sitting in a circle of beach chairs, I expressed my
anxiety about our personal safety to my son, urging him to walk fast and
enter the car through the door farthest from the cluster of tents on the
sidewalk.

"How do you think that makes them feel Mom?" my son asked as we drove
off. "I bet it feels bad to know everyone is afraid of you."

Kids seem to have this ability to imagine themselves in the shoes of
someone in dire straits and what it's like to have no home, to be
sleep-deprived and hungry, and have hundreds of people walk by you each
day and act as if you're not even there.

This compels them to want to help—and it drives my children to urge me
to hand out money whenever anyone approaches us for it.

When I first moved to the city in my early 20s, I remember feeling that
emotional tug-of-war when someone on the street asked for money and I
usually opted to reach into my wallet for a few dollars.

But in the past few years, I find myself dismissing my kids' requests
for cash to give to the woman on the street who clearly could use a new
pair of shoes or the man whose dog looks hungry. I tell them we
shouldn't give money to someone we can't trust will spend it wisely.

Instead of engaging directly with people living on the street, I
enlisted my family to help by volunteering at Glide Memorial Church on
the weekends to make sandwiches included in free bag lunches. We donated
canned food and toys at the holidays. These charitable acts felt
appropriate because we were giving our time and goods to organizations
with reputable track records.

But my children are making me think twice and leading me to realize that
while the volunteering is important, we also need to see homeless
people, break down the wall of cynicism, go with our instincts and
practice random acts of kindness that have positive repercussions in the
life of an individual and in the overall community.

A couple weeks back when my son asked for a dollar to give to someone, I
delivered my usual line, "They'll just use the money to buy drugs."

"But, Mom, maybe they'll know you care," he said back to me.
