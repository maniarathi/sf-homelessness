Dozens of Bay Area news organizations have joined forces to present
stories on the homeless
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/us/san-francisco-homelessness.html?_r=0> next
week, and Berkeleyside is proud to be taking part. On June 29, more than
30 local media outlets have committed to sharing stories about
homelessness, including possible solutions, profiles and more.

We wanted to check in with you, our readers, to find out what questions
are most pressing for you. Please share your thoughts in the comments
section below, or fill out the following Google form. Given the tight
turnaround, we know we won’t be able to address everything. But your
insights will help us shape our coverage going forward as we continue to
delve into one of the most critical issues in Berkeley
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/berkeley-homelessness>.
