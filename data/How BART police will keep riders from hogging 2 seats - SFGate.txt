How BART police will keep riders from hogging 2 seats
1 / 25
Back to Gallery

Starting this fall, BART riders who fail to contain themselves and their
belongings to a single seat during the most crowded times of day may be
questioned by police and have their names recorded and criminal records
checked.

BART Police Chief Kenton Rainey explained Thursday how his officers will
enforce the one-person, one-seat law that the transit agency’s board
adopted in April. The goals, he said, are being fair to riders on
crowded trains while protecting BART from complaints about profiling or
harassment from those whom police question.

But some BART directors, including one supporter of the ordinance,
bristled at the idea that transit police might force first-time
offenders — perhaps tourists on their way from the airport — to identify
themselves and subject them to criminal records checks.

“I think that’s way beyond the pale,” said director Gail Murray of
Walnut Creek, who voted for the antiseat-hogging ordinance.

Murray said BART police should change their enforcement strategy to bar
officers from forcing people to identify themselves if they comply right
away with an officer’s request to occupy only a single seat.

But agency General Manager Grace Crunican said police will be simply
following the terms of the law that the BART board approved. Only the
full board, she said, can dictate how police enforce the law.

First-time offenders will have their names entered into a database and
be given a verbal warning, Rainey said. Those caught hoarding multiple
seats a second time will be given a written warning.

*Fines start with 3rd offense*

On the third offense, a violator will cited. The first citation will
cost $100, the second will cost $200, and each additional ticket after
that will cost $500. If someone is cited a fourth time, he or she can be
arrested.

People whose size or medical condition requires them to occupy more than
one seat will be exempt. BART police will enforce the ordinance weekdays
from 6 to 10 a.m. and 3 to 7:30 p.m., when trains are most crowded.

BART directors adopted the single-seat law at the suggestion of director
Joel Keller of Brentwood. Board President Tom Radulovich
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Tom+Radulovich%22>
voted against the measure, as did board members Nick Josefowitz
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Nick+Josefowitz%22>,
Robert Raburn
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Robert+Raburn%22>
and Rebecca Saltzman
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Rebecca+Saltzman%22>.
Vice President Murray
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Gail+Murray%22>
voted for it, along with board members Thomas Blalock
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Thomas+Blalock%22>,
John McPartland
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22John+McPartland%22>,
Zakhary Mallett
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Zakhary+Mallett%22>
and Keller.

Josefowitz and Saltzman joined Murray in objecting to the enforcement
strategy, which they called extreme. Keller said the directors had no
right to nitpick the way police enforce the ordinance and noted that
they could propose that the law be rescinded. He suggested the board
wait at least six months and review enforcement statistics before
considering doing so.

*Assessing strategy*

McPartland, who has a background in public safety, said the enforcement
strategy seemed cautious and “liberal to a fault.”

“Someone does something wrong and we’re going to give them four shots at
it?” he said.

Rainey said police will enforce the law without regard to whether an
offender is a homeless person, tourist or commuter. The ordinance is
scheduled to take effect Sept. 1, and police will issue only verbal
warnings during the first month.

“It’s going to be applied equally to the person who puts a briefcase on
a seat on a crowded train during the commute or a person who puts a gym
bag on a seat, or the person who puts a suitcase on a seat, or the
person who puts his feet on the seat and goes to sleep,” the chief said.
“We’re going to treat everyone the same.”
