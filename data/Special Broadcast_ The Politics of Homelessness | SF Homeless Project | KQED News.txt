  Special Broadcast: The Politics of Homelessness

A homemade sign that reads "Legalize Sleep."

Panhandling, tents, people passed out on sidewalks, mental illness —
it’s all there on San Francisco streets, in good economic times and bad.
 No matter what politicians do or say, the problem doesn’t seem to go
away. In this special live broadcast, we’ll explore the political forces
that make homelessness such a persistent problem and hear about the
latest propositions put forth by members of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors. And we want to hear from you: If you could make politicians
take one action regarding homelessness, what would it be?
