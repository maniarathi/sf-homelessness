  Change of Address: Voices Humanize Homelessness

The city estimates
<http://www.sfbos.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=56163> that
7,539 San Franciscans lack stable housing. Lumped in a statistic, 7,539
individuals easily blur into one homogeneous identity, a single
misleading notion of what it means to be “homeless.” The “Change of
Address” project aims to challenge that.

In collaboration with SonicSF <http://sonicsf.org/>, a “reality news”
radio show, the Public Press presents a series of audio portraits of
people who are — or are on the verge of becoming — homeless.

These narratives cover a wide range of stories on housing instability.
They reveal what life without a secure home can look, sound and feel
like. The conversations flow from the particulars of each situation. For
every person struggling with homelessness there is a unique path
accompanied by their own set of ideas, passions, hopes and struggles.

“When people are on the streets they get thrown into a label,” said
Michael, who has been homeless for five years. “And sometimes they start
believing that label, rather than believing the truth — which is, we’re
all equal.”

All eight narratives <http://sonicsf.org/change-of-address/> are also
available on SonicSF’s website as part of the June 29 media blitz on
homelessness in the Bay Area.

Production by SonicSF’s Ellison Libiran, Chloe Davidson, and Stacy Bond.

    Previous Homelessness Reporting From the Public Press

The fall 2014 cover story on homelessness
<http://sfpublicpress.org/homelessness> examines in detail the
challenges of wrangling a social service bureaucracy split between the
city's health and human services agencies, with articles and
infographics. Other articles explore evictions from supportive housing
programs, the transformation of the jail into the city’s biggest mental
health facility, a special court meant to prevent that, and a graphic
novel story depicting holes in the social safety net.  |
