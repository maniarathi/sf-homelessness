  Even in 1906, homeless people camped in Golden Gate Park


    In this case, they were displaced by the Great Earthquake

The devastation of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake created a citywide
homeless population of around 250,000 people. Refugees set up makeshift
camps in parks around the city, especially in the Presidio and Golden
Gate Park. This photograph shows an encampment at the bottom of the
Panhandle.
