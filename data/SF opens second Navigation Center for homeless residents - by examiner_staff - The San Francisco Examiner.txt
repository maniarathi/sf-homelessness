San Francisco celebrated the opening of its second Navigation Center on
Tuesday, marking the addition of 93 beds that will serve as temporary
shelters for homeless residents.

Located in the Civic Center Hotel at 20 12th St., the second Navigation
Center builds upon the first that opened in the Mission District in
March 2015. The Civic Center Hotel is owned by the UA Local 38 Plumbers
Union Pension Trust Fund and is slated to be rebuilt in two years into
550 new homes, including 110 affordable homes for formerly homeless
residents.

Touted as a popular model for homeless residents, Navigation Centers
have less rules than conventional homeless shelters. They don’t have
curfews, for instance, and allow pets and belongings. The Mission’s
center has served 550 clients since it opened, 80 percent of whom have
moved into stable supportive housing or were reunited with friends and
family, city officials said.

Guests at Navigation Centers are also provided with mental and health
services and placed on an expedited track to transition within months
into longer-term housing.

“Living on our city’s streets is not healthy or safe,” Mayor Ed Lee said
in a statement. “The Navigation Centers are an important piece in
solving homelessness for those individuals who face multiple challenges
to returning to housing.”

Also Tuesday, The City’s director of the Department of Homelessness Jeff
Kositsky announced the creation of the Encampment Response Team, which
will provide services for those who live in encampments and offer
outreach to neighbors.

“The camps are unsafe and unhealthy for people living in them and are
highly disruptive to our neighborhoods,” Kositsky said in a statement.
“The new encampment response team will ensure our residents living in
encampments receive the shelter and services they deserve and that our
neighborhoods remain safe and healthy for families and everyone.”

In addition to the homeless department, agencies involved in the
encampment response team include the Mayor’s Office, the Homeless
Outreach Team, Public Works, Public Health, the Police Department, the
Fire Department and the Recreation and Parks Department.

Meanwhile, a number of measures could go before voters in November that
would generate money for additional homeless services.

Supervisor Mark Farrell last week submitted for the ballot a measure
that would ban encampments
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/san-francisco-voters-may-ban-homeless-encampments/>
and authorize The City to remove them within 24 hours notice after
offering shelter.

Supervisor Eric Mar confirmed Monday he will place on the ballot
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/voters-may-asked-tax-sf-tech-companies/> a
1.5 percent surtax on tech companies’ payroll in The City that would
generate revenue for homeless and housing services.
