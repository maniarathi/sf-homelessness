Just outside San Francisco City Hall, across Market Street from a
cluster of shiny new tech offices, a nonprofit called Downtown Streets
Team assembles sidewalk cleaning crews staffed by homeless residents for
daily shifts paid in food vouchers.

A few blocks away, Code Tenderloin offers boot camps for homeless and
low-income job seekers, with volunteer teaching assistants from
neighboring Mid-Market tech companies.

Rounding out the roster of local homeless services funded or otherwise
supported by area businesses and their employees are Lava Mae’s portable
showers, Glide’s needle exchange kits and St. Anthony’s technology lab,
among others.

So why, despite record public spending and a plethora of promising
private efforts like these, is one of the richest cities in the country
still plagued by sprawling tent encampments, sidewalks littered with
syringes and violent altercations on public streets during broad daylight?

“San Francisco never really figured out that we need to coordinate the
work we’re doing,” said Jeff Kositsky
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/search/results?q=Jeff%20Kositsky>,
the recently appointed head of Mayor Ed Lee’s new Department of
Homelessness and Supportive Housing, at a recent public forum. “The city
has never really set a clear strategy.”

Though the city alone spent more than $240 million last year on
resources including shelter, health services and supportive housing, the
personal toll for 7,000-plus residents still lacking stable housing is
harder to pinpoint. Kositsky’s new department is slated to receive as
much as $180 million in annual funding, with additional homeless
set-asides for public health.

In the meantime, small- and mid-sized business owners have grown
accustomed to property damage and customer complaints linked to a rising
tide of what they deem threatening or criminal “street behavior.” Large
employers locked in a perpetual battle for talent fear that squalor on
the sidewalks outside their offices will jeopardize already tenuous
recruiting and retention.

The question now is how — and maybe more importantly, who is best
positioned — to contend with a homeless population that has remained
constant, even as unemployment has fallen to 2.8 percent and city
revenue has doubled over the last decade.

“We are all complicit in the fragmentation and collective failure,” said
Alex Briscoe
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/search/results?q=Alex%20Briscoe>,
managing director of T Works, a division of Tipping Point Community that
builds cross-sector partnerships for the common good. “This offers a
unique chance for us to talk about it: What do we owe other members of
society?”

*Boiling point*

It’s taken a messy collision of circumstances, both longstanding and
new, for San Francisco’s homeless epidemic to reach the boiling point
evident today.

Jim Lazarus, vice president of public policy for the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce
<http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/san-francisco-chamber-of-commerce/356833/?mkt=sanfrancisco>,
is fond of pointing out how similar the raw numbers and complicating
factors — an estimated 6,000-8,000 homeless residents, many with mental
health or substance abuse issues — are to when he worked for then-Mayor
Diane Feinstein on homelessness in the 1980s.

“We’ve turned our back on trying to deal with that up-front need, on a
day-in and day-out basis, of a few thousand shelter beds,” Lazarus
contends, advocating also for more visible police presence in
neighborhoods to deter “uncivil behavior.” San Francisco’s police force
fell from 1,916 officers in 2009 to 1,762 in 2012, but has since
rebounded to 2,114 as of February, city data shows.

Others argue that the Bay Area’s skyrocketing housing costs, caused in
part by decades of underproduction of new units aimed at lower income
levels, have shut off avenues to sustainable housing.

“The shelter system basically just perpetuates the problem,” said
Tipping Point’s Briscoe, who previously served as the director of
Alameda County’s Health Care Services Agency.

More recent is the fallout from a national resurgence in heroin use,
which Kositsky calls “apocalyptic.” Meanwhile, incidents like the April
police shooting of 45-year-old homeless man Luis Gongora complicate
proposals to focus on increased law enforcement.

With the pressure and alarm increasing from all sides, Kositsky fears
the debate will lurch toward polarizing proposals to either criminalize
homelessness or legalize encampments.

“Those are both terrible ideas,” he said.

In the three years that his 150-room boutique hotel has been open near
the tourist shopping mecca of Union Square, Steve Rizzo can’t recall a
time when panhandling wasn’t an issue on his doorstep.

People coming in off the street to urinate in the hallway and the
“verbal harassment” of guests? Those are newer issues, some of which
contribute to negative comments in online reviews.

“How does that financially impact us?” said Rizzo, general manager of
Hotel G on Geary Street. “I don’t know that I can count it up.”

The city’s tourism industry, however, is attempting to do just that.
Fresh off of two consecutive banner years for San Francisco tourism —
last year surpassing 24.6 million visitors who spent a total of $9.3
billion — a coalition of business and hospitality groups are warning
that negative visitor experiences linked to homelessness could throw
those numbers into reverse.

San Francisco Travel
<http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/san-francisco-travel/380656/?mkt=sanfrancisco>,
the city’s Hotel Council, the Golden Gate Restaurant Association
<http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/golden-gate-restaurant-association/1181506/?mkt=sanfrancisco>,
the Chamber of Commerce and the Building Owners and Managers Association
have banded together in an effort to urge the city to double down on
increased neighborhood police presence, more emergency shelters and
additional daytime spaces that would keep people off of sidewalks.

“We’re here as a business community worried about the very future of San
Francisco’s brand,” said Joe D’Alessandro, president and CEO of San
Francisco Travel.

Meeting and event planners are reportedly being told by an increasing
number of both groups and individuals that they won’t return to the city
after experiencing or witnessing unpleasant street behavior (though most
planners declined to discuss the issue on the record.) Using some rough
back-of-the-envelope math, SFTravel contends that if visitors were to
make good on their 25 percent negative survey feedback and decline to
return to San Francisco, the city could lose thousands of jobs and
millions of dollars in revenue.

D’Alessandro pointed out the city was recently dethroned after a 19-year
run atop a tony Conde Nast magazine list of the nation’s most desirable
destinations, due to lacking “friendliness.”

*Seeking solutions*

With help from the city slow in coming, some business groups are
starting to take matters into their own hands with private solutions
aimed at tackling different facets of homelessness.

The Fisherman’s Wharf Community Benefit District successfully lobbied
for the return of some local beat police officers pared back during the
recession. The additional personnel slashed the estimated $60,000 per
year property owners at the popular tourist area were paying to hire
off-duty police through the city’s 10B program, said district Executive
Director Troy Campbell
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/search/results?q=Troy%20Campbell>.

The Union Square Business District last year also became the first in
the city to hire a social work for on-the-ground case management.

At Sixth and Market streets, customer service software provider Zendesk
<http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/zendesk/100209/?mkt=sanfrancisco>
is staying busy with philanthropic efforts. Writing a $20,000 check to
Code Tenderloin and sending employee volunteers to assemble clean needle
kits at Glide are two recent examples.

Yes, the Mid-Market company is governed by a negotiated community
benefit agreement as a participant in the so-called “Twitter tax break,”
but Tiffany Apczynski, vice president of public policy and social impact
at Zendesk, said that’s not the only reason for getting involved.

“This is a neighborhood that’s still totally in crisis,” she added.
“There is still a lot of crap that happens.”

Aside from the Mid-Market tech cohort and familiar corporate
philanthropy powerhouses, like Google.org, companies including Silicon
Valley Bank
<http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/silicon-valley-bank/144811/?mkt=sanfrancisco>
and Benchmark Capital
<http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/benchmark-capital/121143/?mkt=sanfrancisco>
have also chipped in funding or job training services for homeless
causes. In the realm of policy advocacy, business groups including the
Bay Area Council and Chamber of Commerce tend to focus on lobbying to
encourage bolstering housing supply across income brackets.

*Next steps*

As a seasoned tech executive and former Napster CEO, Eileen Richardson
thought she was in for a quick turnaround job when she decided to take a
sabbatical focused on social service.

It turned out to be her toughest gig to date.

“I arrogantly figured I could solve this homeless problem in Palo Alto
and roll it out across the country in about 6 months,” Richardson
recalled. “That was 11 years ago.”

Now, the nonprofit she helms, Downtown Streets Team, has a budget of $6
million thanks to contracts brokered with local business improvement
districts and other cleaning providers in 10 cities. The most recent
city: San Francisco, where individuals joining daily cleaning teams
receive housing and job training support in addition to food vouchers.

The model is one example of several, along with Code Tenderloin,
“venture philanthropy” funder RED-F and The Learning Shelter, of
organizations looking to deviate from what Code Tenderloin Director of
Business Development Neil Shah calls “the stereotypical slow nonprofit.”

Another new model is in the works at Tipping Point, which was founded by
philanthropist Daniel Lurie. Under Briscoe’s leadership, a new team
funded with a $5 million anonymous grant will look to marry his previous
knowledge of gaps in the public sector with cold, hard executive cash.

“Folks are looking for someone without a specific interest,” Briscoe
said. “What needs to happen is a coordination of goals and objectives
across interests and across sectors.”

Already on Kositsky’s wish list is a $25 million fundraising effort
among businesses and philanthropy to move the city’s 200-plus homeless
families into stable housing. Seed funding for “pop-up shelter”
prototypes and more robust data analytics are two other areas where he
sees possible intersection with businesses off the bat.

Several efforts in the works are taking aim at the issue of data.

At Zendesk, Apczynski is funding an effort to document each instance of
intervention necessary on the streets of the mid-Market neighborhood in
hopes of creating a jumping off point for conversations with the city.
Small businesses, too, are mobilizing with the help of San Francisco
startup Townsquared, which aims to create a similar “street report” of
all issues in a given area for examples of specific issues that could be
addressed.

Perhaps the most ambitious public homeless data project under way in the
Bay Area is a first-of-its-kind effort in California in neighboring San
Jose.

Using donated data aggregation and analytics software from Palantir and
a $500,000 grant from Google’s philanthropic arm, Santa Clara County has
embarked on a six-year pilot of a “pay for success” model, where
nonprofit provider Abode Home Services only gets paid if participants
stay housed for designated amounts of time.

For this project and others, the county is exploring the potential of
financial innovation as well in the form of “social impact investing,”
said Director of Supportive Housing Ky Le.

“How much risk are they willing to assume, and how much return makes
sense?” Le said. “That’s not an easy question to answer.”

        S.F. Homelessness: The new players who are entering the game

There’s not an app to neatly fix San Francisco’s homelessness epidemic.
There is, however, a range of public, private and nonprofit efforts
aimed at making a dent in the city’s struggle to provide adequate
shelter in the face of a shrinking social safety net.

As the city itself rethinks a fragmented funding and service delivery
model, the private sector is applying business principles to
philanthropy. Job training outfits now emulate fast-moving startups,
eschewing rigid curriculums. Here are some of the more promising new
players and programs.

*REDF*

Launched by George Roberts, a founding partner of private equity giant
KKR, REDF is a San Francisco nonprofit that operates with a “venture
philanthropy” model.

With a focus on funding job training efforts with potential to
permanently lift people out of homelessness, REDF funds 60 social
enterprises that employ a total of 11,000 people and have generated a
combined $63 million in revenue.

“We call it equity-like investment,” said REDF President and CEO Carla
Javitz. “It’s not just, ‘Oh that’s a nice idea, we’ll give you a little
money.’ We want you to go out and do it, and we’ll work side by side
with you.”

*Tipping Point’s T Works*

On July 1 Tipping Point, the nonprofit grantmaking organization founded
by philanthropist Daniel Lurie, will officially add chronic homelessness
to its agenda.

An anonymous $5 million donation will fund Tipping Point Community’s new
T Works effort, headed by former Alameda County Health Care Services
Agency Director Alex Briscoe
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/search/results?q=Alex%20Briscoe>.
The goal: Leverage private wealth to fill gaps in the city’s current
homeless relief efforts.

“There are ways for targeted investment to grease the skids for public
funding,” Briscoe said. “This is not something that wealthy people can
fund their way out of.”

*Townsquared Street Report*

Beyond filing a complaint with the city’s 311 service or bringing
individual issues to neighborhood associations, small business owners
don’t always feel like they have a lot of recourse for troubling
conditions just outside their doors.

One nascent effort to better document their grievances — and then get
them to the right people at city hall — is to compile a “street report”
through the existing online small business platform managed by
Mission-based startup Townsquared.

“The first step is to make sure that all the business owners in San
Francisco know they’re not alone. The second step is to catalog those
issues,” said Townsquared Co-founder and CEO Ro Prakash. “The third step
is to, with permission, allow stories that are being told there to be
shared in a constructive way witha the city.”

*San Francisco Department of Homelessness & Supportive Housing*

While businesses work to coordinate their efforts, the City of San
Francisco is also in the midst of a seismic shift in the way funds and
services are allocated.

Starting this summer, the new Department of Homelessness & Supportive
Housing will centralize the work previously done by the city’s Human
Services Agency, Public Health Department and the Mayor’s Office of
Housing, Opportunity, Partnerships and Engagement (HOPE).

“Just by coordinating our services this way we’re going to see a 10-20
percent reduction in the number of people, maybe more,” said newly
appointed director Jeff Kositsky
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/search/results?q=Jeff%20Kositsky>.
“If it’s not up and running and fully functional within the next two
years, you should tell the mayor to fire me.”

*Code Tenderloin*

Neil Shah quit his job in corporate finance the same day he took a
walking tour through the Tenderloin with longtime resident Del Seymour
last year.

Seymour used to sell drugs in the neighborhood, but he’s now made enough
headway engaging area tech companies to launch hyperlocal job training
program Code Tenderloin. After five-week boot camps that come with
housing and food stipends, the goal is to get participants into either
entry-level jobs at local companies or onto scholarships to bigger
computer engineering programs.

“Now your whole diversity and inclusion effort and all that can actually
happen,” Shah says to would-be employers.

*The Learning Shelter*

Marc Roth knows first-hand how frustrating long, drawn out job training
programs can be for individuals who slip into homelessness in
high-priced San Francisco.

“If they got you a job, there was no way you could live off it,” said
Roth, a former IBM engineer who has since launched “Uber for heavy
machinery” company Abricate. “It was like, ‘Here’s a path to go work for
a bit — and we’ll see you back here in a year.’”

After climbing his own way out of a shelter bed in the city doing
hands-on work at TechShop, he started pitching the idea of job training
cost-effectively housed inside a shipping container in 2012. After
briefly operating independently, the Learning Shelter functions as a
“consultancy” to service providers interested in replicating the model,
Roth said, in part because it was so difficult to win funding from large
grantees.
