A homeless man begs for change on December 10, 2012 in San Francisco,
California.	

As part of SF Project Homeless, a week of coordinated media coverage on
homelessness in the Bay Area, KQED asked our listeners what questions
they have about homelessness. We received more than 1,200 responses,
with questions ranging from what are the root causes of homelessness to
how to respond when someone is passed out on the sidewalk. In this hour,
we’ve gathered a group of people who work with the homeless across a
variety of disciplines to answer those questions.


      Interview Highlights

*On What Causes Homelessness*

“We have a poverty problem in this country. Thirty percent of Americans
are at or near the poverty level. When you have that level of poverty,
you’re not going to eliminate homelessness; you’re fixing homelessness
on the other end. If we had the kind of affordable housing funding we
had way back, decades ago, it’d be a different picture. If the minimum
wage paid what it paid decades ago, instead of half what it did in 1980
in terms of buying power, we’d have a different picture. So we’re
essentially bailing the tide out.” – Kevin Fagan

*On Other Cities Sending Homeless People to the Bay Area*

“Through my years of coverage, I’ve visited homeless enclaves all over
the country. Every city says that people are sending their homeless
people to them, even cold cities. The weather’s good out here, so you
get a few more. But I don’t think there’s a giant influx of people
coming out here … I just don’t buy the idea that if you do better,
you’re going to become the Disneyland of Homelessness.” -Kevin Fagan

*On Why San Francisco’s Homeless Problem Seems So Bad*

“It is very visible here, I think in part because we’re in such a small
confined space. The more we develop the city, the more people will come
out of the shadows and become more visible.” -Scott Prentice

“We have the most visible homeless problem in the country, because it’s
right downtown.” -Kevin Fagane

*On Whether to Call 9-1-1 or 3-1-1*

“If [the person] appears to be in any type of distress whatsoever or you
have any doubts whatsoever, just call 9-1-1. An ambulance can respond
much faster than the homeless outreach team. If the person’s okay, the
ambulance or police responder may just call us afterwards.

Personally, I’m more interested in connecting people to services. I
encourage people to call 3-1-1 and get in touch with the [Homeless
Outreach Team] if they’re concerned about someone on the street.” -Scott
Prentice

*On How SF’s Homeless Outreach Team Responds to Calls*

“We’ll send somebody out, hopefully that day, to check on them. We’ll
come back in, we’ll discuss them, we’ll reengage them time and time
again until we’ve built a relationship with that person, and then we’ll
try our best to either get them into a shelter or medical care.” -Scott
Prentice
