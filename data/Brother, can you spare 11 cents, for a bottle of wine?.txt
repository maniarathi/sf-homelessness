  Brother, can you spare 11 cents, for a bottle of wine?


    Panhandling on Howard Street in 1941

The caption for this photo makes mention of what is now a very familiar
practice for the homeless in San Francisco: “Howard St. citizens have a
new system for digging up the 11c necessary to buy a bottle of wine.
It’s to panhandle for pennies from passersby with a collection box for
each donation.”
