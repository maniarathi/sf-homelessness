  From homeless in San Francisco to a job in the tech industry

From homeless in SF to a job in tech <javascript:void(0)> // From
homeless in SF to a job in tech

Del Seymour grew up on the streets of San Francisco, where he spent 12
years of his life homeless yet determined to do something about it. He
was tired of "all talk and no action," so Seymour took it upon himself
to create a solution to a problem that plagued his youth.

Seymour's idea of a solution to homelessness isn't centered around
finding immediate housing or a source of food, contradicting the
"housing first" mentality that many people in the city believe is the
answer, he said. Seymour's solution is employment.

"A lot of people want to stick it on mental illness, which is a part of
it," Seymour said in an interview. "They stick it on social issues, and
that's a part of it. They stick it on criminal background, and that's a
part of it. But the real deal is employment. ... You cannot go and rent
a decent house without employment. You have to pay for that house."

Last September Seymour formed Code Tenderloin, an incubator that takes
participants through either a job readiness program, where students
build a resume and prepare for job interviews, or a coding bootcamp,
where students are taught front-end web development.

Since its launch, Code Tenderloin has sent more than 60 people back to
work by way of partnerships with tech companies such as Zendesk, Airbnb,
Dolby and Uber. Instead of viewing the tech companies as the "bad guys,"
Seymour said he was thinking of ways to work with them — ways to form
relationships that would benefit everyone in San Francisco — as they
flocked to the city around 2012.

The gap between the rich and the poor intensified quickly as the offices
of Spotify, Square, Twitter <http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR> and
Yammer flooded San Francisco's Tenderloin and South of Market
neighborhoods, some of the city's poorest and most underdeveloped areas
at the time. Seymour saw an opportunity to bridge the divide and has
worked ever since to bring the two parties together.

"Most people don't know the tech campuses — only 70 percent of the jobs
in the tech campuses are tech-centered," Seymour explained. "The rest
are front office, facilities maintenance, culinary, security, customer
service, shipping and receiving. ... So we're trying to fill some of
those jobs immediately when they open up to us."

Code Tenderloin calls its mission "Crossing Market," after Market
Street, since most of the tech community is situated south of Market
St., and most of San Francisco's unemployed men and women reside north
of Market.

"We went viral in the Tenderloin," Neil Shah, a lead volunteer at Code
Tenderloin, said in an interview. "Our job is to now scale this to other
neighborhoods, to go into the hardest-hit areas and be a disruptor."

Today, Code Tenderloin has placed its students at companies such as
Dolby, Lending Club <http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/LC>, WeWork, Google
<http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL>, Macy's
<http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/M>, Target
<http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT> and Dropbox.

Retention is also important for Seymour, who said "my job begins the day
they start theirs." More than 85 percent of Code Tenderloin participants
have kept their jobs, Seymour said, and he continues to visit graduates
after they leave his program, ensuring they have the resources they need
to go to work every day.

Without more programs like Code Tenderloin, Seymour doesn't see the city
being able to reduce homelessness in the future. "I have not seen an
aggressive enough plan to deal with [homelessness]," Seymour said.
"There are too many silos. People are working in silos and not coming
together on the issues."


        Homelessness: A growing problem in San Francisco

In January 2015, 564,708 people across the U.S. were homeless on any
given night, according to a report
<https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2015-AHAR-Part-1.pdf>
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD.
Homelessness declined nationwide by 2 percent between 2014 and 2015, and
by 11 percent since 2007, the report said.

California accounted for 21 percent of the nation's homeless population
in 2015, or 115,738 people. Between 2014 and 2015, 17 states experienced
increases in homelessness. New York had the largest increase, followed
by California, HUD said.

In conjunction with the nationwide count, the city of San Francisco
conducts its own Homeless Count & Survey
<http://sfgov.org/lhcb/sites/sfgov.org.lhcb/files/2015%20San%20Francisco%20Homeless%20Count%20Report_0.pdf>.
The number of homeless in San Francisco's streets and shelters in 2015
was 6,686, an increase of 250 individuals compared with 2013, the latest
report found. A 10-year analysis found a 7 percent increase in the
number of people living without a home in San Francisco between 2005 and
2015.

Based on 2015 data, 57 percent of the unsheltered homeless population
was located in District 6, which includes the Tenderloin and South of
Market neighborhoods, and 25 percent of respondents reported job loss as
the primary cause of their homelessness.

Many individuals surveyed by the city said that employment and income
were not enough to meet their basic needs. The unemployment rate for
homeless respondents in San Francisco was 89 percent, up from 62 percent
in 2013. Of those who were unemployed, the primary barriers to
employment included a lack of a permanent address, clothing and showers.
Twenty percent of respondents in San Francisco cited a dependence on
drug or alcohol as an obstacle, the report said.

Seymour said he's studied the stats, and he sees unemployment as the
biggest the problem, so that's where he's targeting his efforts today —
toward creating jobs.


        Twitter, other tech companies show support

"After joining Twitter, Del was one of the first coffees I had,"
Caroline Barlerin, Twitter's head of community outreach and
philanthropy, said in an interview. "I went on a walking tour with the
unofficial 'Mayor of the Tenderloin' to hear from him what's working and
what's not. He's an expert, and he's bridging the world of tech and the
Tenderloin in a meaningful way."

Twitter hosted Code Tenderloin's first graduating class and is heavily
involved with the nonprofit's fundraising campaign today, Barlerin said.
Twitter employees volunteer to talk with Code Tenderloin participants
about careers in tech and coding, and its engineers have been mentors to
those who hope to pursue a job in the industry.

"Del gives people hope and a pathway, and he's helping people take the
first step to the future," Barlerin said. "Del is changing the
trajectory for the homeless. … He's getting them housed."

Code Tenderloin has received an influx of donations as of late,
including $5,000 from Twitter in 2015, followed by $5,000 in 2016, Code
Tenderloin volunteer Shah said. Dolby gave $30,000 to Code Tenderloin
this year, after a $10,000 donation in 2015. The nonprofit has received
additional investments from Zendesk, Benchmark Capital, Yammer and the
Mid-Market Business Association, Shah said.

Zendesk has been another one of Code Tenderloin's biggest supporters, by
hosting events in its office's communal space and sending Zendesk
employees on Seymour's guided walking tours of the Tenderloin. In the
future, Zendesk will be a "feeder" employee for students who graduate
from Code Tenderloin's job-readiness program, Tiffany Apczynski, vice
president of public policy and social impact at Zendesk, said in an
interview.

"There are plenty of roles in our organizations," Apczynski said. "We're
tech companies, but we're not all engineers. So you just have to open
yourself up to hiring employees coming from a nontraditional pathway,
then everybody is going to grow and benefit from that."

Many who know Seymour say he's pioneering a movement in bringing the
tech community and the city's homeless together, something he believes
will get people off the streets faster than any other solutions being
proposed in San Francisco.
