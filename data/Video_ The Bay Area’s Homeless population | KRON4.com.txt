(KRON) This week KRON4 News and dozens of media outlets across the Bay
Area are shining a spotlight on the homeless crisis.

All week with its media partners KRON4 is examining several parts of the
epidemic and telling stories of the homeless you may not ordinarily see
or hear.

San Francisco’s homeless population is tops in the Bay Area with more
than 7,500 people calling the streets home.

Oakland has more than 3,000 homeless people.

In San Jose there are more than 4,000 homeless people living on the streets.

*KRON4 San Francisco Homeless Project Section
<http://kron4.com/category/sf-homeless-project/>*

On Monday California senators  approved a $2 billion bond to build
permanent housing for mentally ill homeless people.

The plan senators passed would use money from an existing fund for
mental health care financed by a tax on millionaires that voters
approved in 2004.

It requires counties to provide supportive services for people housed
with state aid.

Democratic leaders proposed the plan in January and Gov. Jerry Brown has
endorsed it. The Senate approved AB1618 on a 35-1 vote Monday, sending
it to the Assembly.

Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon of Los Angeles says
homelessness and mental illness affect everyone. He praised the
Legislature for crafting a creative, bipartisan measure.

Federal housing officials estimate more than 29,000 homeless
Californians were living with serious mental illness in 2015.
