  *Tipping Point Launches T Works: Homelessness*

/New division will address chronic homelessness in San Francisco/

In an unprecedented effort to focus our attention as a community, today,
more than 70 news outlets
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/us/san-francisco-homelessness.html?_r=0>
across our region are reporting on an issue that we know all too well:
homelessness. In San Francisco, the face of the new economy, this
epidemic couldn’t be more stark. With a bias towards solving difficult
problems, the city should be leading the nation in this fight, but it is
clear that in order to do that there must be a new approach to this
decades-long challenge.

Today, Tipping Point Community <https://tippingpoint.org/> is announcing
T Works: Homelessness, <http://www.tippingpoint.org/TWorks> a new
division focused on building cross-sector partnerships for the common
good. Under the leadership of Alex Briscoe, T Works: Homelessness will
invest an initial $5 million to better serve the chronically homeless in
San Francisco.

    “Homelessness is a symptom of what’s broken all around us,” said
    Briscoe. “With minimal support for young people aging out of foster
    care and few viable options for those coming out of our justice
    system, it’s no mystery how people end up on the streets. We have to
    attack these problems at their roots. And we have to allow the lives
    and experiences of the homeless themselves to guide this work.”

Tipping Point has been working on issues of poverty for 11 years by
investing in the most promising organizations focused on educating,
housing, employing, and supporting people living in poverty. Throughout
this time, the organization has impacted the lives of more than 600,000
low-income people across the Bay Area. T Works represents a new
opportunity to leverage private dollars, develop partnerships with local
government and align around measures of mutual accountability.

    “The public sector has the scale to generate systemic change.
    Philanthropic dollars are nimble — they can build, they can create,
    they can inform,” said Daniel Lurie, Tipping Point’s CEO +
    Founder.*“*We have to work harder and smarter to serve those who are
    suffering. Above all, we have to work together.”

*About Tipping Point Community*

Since 2005, Tipping Point Community has raised more than $100 million to
educate, employ, house and support over 600,000 people in need. Tipping
Point screens non-profits rigorously to find, fund and partner with the

1.3 million people in the Bay Area are too poor to meet their basic
needs. Without intervention, 7 in 10 people born in poverty will remain
in poverty their entire lives. With your help, Tipping Point Community
is tipping the odds.
