  Gilman Street underpass: For many, the poster child of Berkeley
  homeless camps

June 29, 2016 2:53 pm by Frances Dinkelspiel
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/author/frances/>	
This man, who didn't want to give his name, lives by the Gilman
underpass. He makes $30 to $40 a day scavenging. He finds lots of food
(people throw away a lot from Trader Joe's) as well as things like
scooters, skateboards, etc. When Caltrans and Berkeley recently cleaned
out the camp, he just went across the street and returned when they
left, he said. Photo: Frances Dinkelspiel

Bood, 37, lives by the Gilman underpass. He makes $30 to $40 a day
scavenging. He finds lots of food (people throw away a lot from Trader
Joe’s) as well as things like scooters, skateboards, etc. When Caltrans
and Berkeley recently cleaned out the camp, he just went across the
street and returned when they left, he said. Photo: Frances Dinkelspiel

Bood’s home is a blue tarp on Eastshore Freeway, the frontage road right
by the Gilman Street underpass
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/gilman-underpass/>. At 37, he’s been
living on the streets for a few years, driven there by a break-up with a
long-time girlfriend.

Bood scavenges for a living. He makes the rounds in Berkeley and El
Cerrito looking for tossed food (a lot of people throw away food from
Trader Joe’s, he said) and discarded clothing he can sell to Buffalo
Exchange and other consignment stores. The area around his tarp reflects
the way he makes a living: There are folding chairs, rugs, candles and
flashlights, among other items.

Caltrans, the California Highway Patrol, Berkeley police and city
workers came to the area to clean it out about two weeks ago, June 16.
They carted away garbage trucks full of debris. They also found more
than 250 used hypodermic needles and bottles of urine
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/16/authorities-clear-out-gilman-homeless-camp/>,
as well as feces and dead rodents.

Did the clean up have any effect on Bood and the rest of the people
hanging out in the area?

No.

“We gathered our stuff up, we went across the street and waited for them
to leave,” said Bood, who did not give his last name. “Then we set back up.”

Bood characterized the clean-up as “a game, a dance, a wink, wink.”
Almost every two weeks Caltrans workers come by and sweep through the
Gilman underpass area. Almost as soon as they are gone, the squatters
return.

In recent years, the underpass encampment has become one of the most
visible signs of homelessness in Berkeley. People’s Park used to be
considered the epicenter of homelessness since so many people camped out
there overnight. But ever since the city of Albany evicted the homeless
people living at The Bulb and paid them $3,000 to leave, Gilman has
taken center stage.

“The vast majority of the folks from Gilman tell me they came from the
Albany Bulb,” said Berkeley Police Officer Chris Scott. He is the Area 4
coordinator, the community liaison for a large area mostly west of San
Pablo Avenue.

The sight of people with tents, rugs and chairs amassed on the sidewalk
is deeply disturbing to many Berkeley residents. A number of those
living there are very dirty. Staph infections are common. So is drug
use. In recent weeks, police have made arrests for an assault with a
deadly weapon, brandishing a weapon, and sexual assault, said Scott.

“Gilman is a homeless encampment with tents, carts and garbage that
looks like a 3rd world country,” one reader wrote to Berkeleyside. “It’s
a nightmare that nobody wants to touch.”

Berkeley offers a myriad of services
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/homelessness-in-berkeley-the-fact-sheet/>
to the 800 to 1,200 or so people who live in the city but don’t have a
permanent home. But those around the Gilman underpass are the most
service-resistant.

“We hear from many folks that they are aware of the services,” said
Scott. “They don’t want them.”

Bood is an example of someone who doesn’t want to enter Berkeley’s
shelter system. He came from Philadelphia a year ago. He was heading to
Oregon with a friend, but when that friend left unexpectedly, Bood
decided to stay in the Bay Area.

“I settled in Berkeley because it’s the easiest place to get by,” he said.

Bood earns $30 to $40 a day collecting and selling stuff and uses that
money to eat and get high. He has set up his tarp on the side of the
frontage road and on a recent sunny Thursday people were sitting in
chairs socializing. The community around the underpass is like any
community, said Bood. It’s not a monolithic group. One-third of the
people are great, one-third are “assholes, and one-third are “insane,”
he said.

Bood characterizes himself as “a decent person in odd circumstances.”

Even though theft is rampant and some of the people he interacts with
are clearly mentally ill, Bood said he has no intention of trading in
his lifestyle, which affords him independence, for the shelter system.

“Shelters are like jails,” he said, referring to the strict wake-up and
sleep times.

Vicky who is pregnant, said last week she would like the city to provide
a plot of land for camping or, at the very least, some dumpsters near
the underpass. She said she prefers being in the camp to living
somewhere alone: “We’re all family in one way or another, all one big
family.” Photo: Emilie Raguso

Thomas Barnett, 55, agrees.

“You have to be there at their time, certain times,” he said. “If I go
down there I could be missing out on making a few dollars (from
scavenging).”

He said he also needs a place, like a workshop or a garage, where he
could keep all his bikes and other items safe.

Barnett was born in Santa Rosa but moved when he was young with his
family to Oklahoma. He lived for years in Broken Arrow working as a
supervisor in a product plant. The work was relentless and one night
after working for many hours straight he crashed his truck going 70 mph.
The accident wrenched his back so he couldn’t work. It sent him in a
downward spiral, one that brought him to the streets of Berkeley about
18 years ago, he said. Life is still traumatic for Barnett. In the fall,
his 21-year-old son died of a heart attack after drinking two energy
drinks in quick succession.

Barnett gets $780 from General Assistance and supplements his income by
rebuilding bicycles. He had two distinct piles of bicycle parts along
Eastshore Freeway, one of rims, one of tires. Barnett said the bikes,
many of which are in what he calls “junky” condition, are not stolen. He
finds discarded ones around, he said. And people bring them to him to
barter or sell.

When someone offers him a bike that looks like it may have been stolen,
he said, he makes up a reason not to take it. Working on the bikes gives
him something to keep himself busy.

“It’s something to occupy my time,” he said. “There’s really not
anything to do.”

a good place to live because “it’s dry when it rains.” He said he would

Many Berkeleyside readers have commented that they think the heaps of
bikes in that area are mostly stolen. They ask why police can’t do
anything about it.

Officer Scott says police can’t just go up to someone and ask to look at
a bike or bike part. Police need probable cause to search someone. If a
person says something like “My bike was stolen and it had a red frame
and this kind of wheel and I see a similar bike in the pile,” then
police can investigate.

Many of those at the Gilman underpass said they are tired of being
hassled by Caltrans and Berkeley workers and police. Osha Neumann, an
attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center who frequently
represents the homeless in court, said he is thinking about filing a
class action suit because people’s possessions keep getting confiscated
during the sweeps.

Many beneath the freeway believe the city should give them a plot of
land on which to live rather than criminalizing them for camping on the
sidewalk.

“We have a right to exist without paying rent,” said Brandon, 41. He did
not provide his last name. “Where should we go?”

“You just go to where you can. You just stick it out until they tell you
to leave,” said another man nearby, who declined to give his name
because of a pending claim of his own against Caltrans for confiscated
property.

The idea of setting aside an area for the homeless might not be a total
pipe dream. Berkeley has allowed a number of short-term experiments
where people without homes have been allowed to stay. The most famous
may have been Rainbow Village
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/berkeley-homelessness-a-timeline-from-1982-to-2016/>,
set up in 1985 near the dump. Berkeley set aside about half an acre for
cars and vans to park. At its peak, there were about 40 people there.

But Berkeley shut the village down after two of its dwellers,
“Deadheads” who were passing through, were murdered.

In November and part of December, a number of homeless activists set up
an encampment in front of Old City Hall. They named it Liberty City
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/Liberty-City/> and said they would
police themselves. They made the camp alcohol and drug free and even
booted out some prostitutes.

But Berkeley regarded Liberty City as a health hazard and shut it down.

The city is considering another self-rule experiment
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/homelessness-in-berkeley-an-overview/>,
according to Councilwoman Linda Maio, who declined to give details
because the planning is in the early stages.

In the meantime, residents beneath the freeway say they would, at the
very least, like to have a dumpster or some smaller trash bins nearby.
But that doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome, at least for now.

“With limited resources, efforts are put toward putting people into
housing
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/berkeley-seeks-to-house-those-most-in-need-at-the-hub/>
rather than into services such as garbage or portable restrooms for
encampments,” said Matthai Chakko, city spokesman. “In terms of
delivering services, it’s the smartest and best use of money.”
