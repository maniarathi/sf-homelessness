In the psychiatric unit of the newly named Zuckerberg San Francisco
General Hospital
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/related-entities/?eid=2528413401&ename=Zuckerberg%20San%20Francisco%20General%20Hospital&lang=en>,
mental health care providers see the most acute cases of mental illness.
The burden of mental illness manifests with each visit to the
psychiatric emergency room for a psychotic break, each admission to the
medicine ward for skin infection from intravenous drug use, each stay in
the ICU for a failed suicide attempt.

In therapeutic terms, the purpose of psychiatric hospitalizations is to
“hold and contain” patients in a safe space until the crisis eases with
medication and therapy, at which point they can be discharged to a less
acute, less restrictive environment. Yet ZSFG has seen, over the past
year, an increase in the number of psychiatric patients who cannot be
discharged to a safe environment due to the dwindling number of beds in
available facilities. Because of this, the average length-of-stay in the
inpatient psychiatric ward has increased, with an overflow of
psychiatric patients into other medical services, psychiatric emergency
room or, worse, County Jail.

Serious mental illness is unique in that its disease course involves a
complex of factors that may start as trauma during childhood and often
involves a terrible cycle of poverty, social exclusion and addiction
that is exacerbated by homelessness. Without treatment and support,
these insidious factors push the most vulnerable into a slow, downward
trajectory away from mainstream society.

The current housing crisis is directly linked to the acute rise in
homeless populations on the streets of San Francisco. As housing prices
and cost of living increase, those at the bottom who were tenuously
housed are now being squeezed out.

For vulnerable populations — in particular, the mentally ill with poor
social supports — there are few alternatives to the streets. I have met
multiple female patients who prefer to stay in the streets rather than
go to shelters, where their only belongings may be stolen, and who have
been previously traumatized by physical or sexual assault. In addition,
privately owned facilities, which provide respite such as board-and-care
facilities, are being closed down and sold due to the high prices they
can now command.

The result of this is an increase in the number of homeless people, as
well as decreased access to services, and poor utilization of limited
resources for the most vulnerable. What can be done to improve this
situation?

As a society, we must first rid ourselves of inherent biases against
mental illness. A dangerous prejudice remains against the mentally ill.
Like medical ills, psychiatric disease happens to patients, and
depression, anxiety or psychotic thoughts cannot be simply willed away.

More concretely, we must recognize destabilizing effects of homelessness
on those with existing mental illness. We must safeguard and expand
low-income housing and safe shelters for the most vulnerable, including
single-room occupancies, board-and-care facilities, acute diversion
units and sub-acute locked facilities for those who cannot otherwise
live independently in society.

It’s time to increase our city’s capacity to provide free mental
healthcare for the many patients who want treatment for their
psychiatric illnesses but are turned away because all the appointment
slots are full. Let’s educate and incentivize healthcare providers to
work in the public sphere and fund scientific research to improve our
current treatments for these devastating diseases.

The goal is to allow patients to return to a productive and meaningful
life unencumbered by illness as much as possible. The end result will be
a decongestion of our streets and our jails, and more importantly, basic
justice for those who cannot unite and advocate for themselves.
