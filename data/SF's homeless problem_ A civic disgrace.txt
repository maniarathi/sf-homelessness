  A civic disgrace

* Each figure represents 2

It persists on the streets of San Francisco through boom times and
downturns. It is alternately an incubator and a destroyer of political
will, as elected representatives eventually discover that their pledges
to address it become their undoing when it doesn’t go away. It takes a
heavy toll on the ambience of our neighborhoods, the cost of doing
business for many enterprises and the experience of visitors who are
stunned to encounter such deprivation in a city of profound prosperity.

It frustrates and polarizes San Francisco like nothing else. There are
those who see it as a social-services challenge, those who reduce it to
a law-enforcement matter, and a few who think the problem would simply
go away if only there were more affordable housing in the city.

On one point we must all agree: The level and pervasiveness of
homelessness in San Francisco is a disgrace. It is simply not acceptable
to allow people to stay in the squalor of tent encampments or sleep in
doorways, parks and freeway underpasses without attention to the
underlying issues that prevent them from attaining shelter and stability
in their lives. It’s bad for public safety, bad for public health, and
bad as a matter of basic humanity.

Its reduction to the extent humanly possible should be this city’s No. 1
priority.

The ultimate goal must be to eliminate, not manage, homelessness.

No mayor, no member of the Board of Supervisors — no resident with heart
and a love for this city — should accept the status quo.

That a city can spend $241 million a year on programs and still confront
such human misery suggests those dollars are not being spent with
anything close to optimal effectiveness. Eight city departments and 76
private and nonprofit organizations draw from those funds in 400
contracts, yet the degree of accountability is highly suspect. There is
no system in place to rigorously determine which of those endeavors
might be duplicative or less effective. In Houston, for example, the
city was able to realize considerable savings by shutting down a
homeless-specific job training program and sending participants to other
existing similar programs covered by state and federal dollars.

San Francisco has an entrenched Homeless Industrial Complex that is as
difficult to track and control as it is to count people living on the
streets.

Yes, it surely will require an increased investment in services and
housing to give the homeless a credible chance of moving off the
streets. It could require bond measures or general-fund spending that
will need public support. That assent will be far more attainable if
accompanied by confidence that dollars are being well spent.

Programs that are underperforming should be eliminated to free up
dollars for those that are showing results. That must be an essential
mission for Jeff Kositsky, leader of the new Department of Homelessness
and Supportive Housing created by Mayor Ed Lee.

One of the recurring themes in our series of news stories in the past
week was the frustration of those on the front lines, in government and
nonprofit services, that the available programs do not match all the
essential needs of people trying to emerge from homelessness. That would
include people who have made progress in substance-abuse or mental
health treatment who could be in less structured settings — at much
lower cost — and people stuck in the austere shelters who could benefit
greatly from the array of support services available in the Navigation
Centers.

The city needs to evaluate and track people in homeless programs to
assure that they are put in the most suitable settings for both
effective use of taxpayer dollars and availability of services that will
give individuals the support for moving beyond homelessness. Houston and
Salt Lake City have established such tracking systems.

The Chronicle’s extensive reporting on the state of homelessness has
offered a compelling template for solutions. Again, there are lessons to
be learned from other cities. New York City’s FUSE (Frequent Users
Service Enhancement) program identifies people most likely to end up in
jail or emergency rooms, and directs them to housing and services. A
2014 report showed that 86 percent remained in housing two years after
entering the program — more than double the rate in a comparison group.

The severe effects of chronic homelessness on the city budget and life
on the streets is no secret in San Francisco. Those with the most acute
dysfunction due to substance abuse or mental illness represent a
disproportionate strain on the budget. They too often become caught in a
brutal cycle of jail stays, ambulance rides and emergency care. Some
1,500 chronically homeless people cost the city about $80,000 a year
each; the figure rises to $150,000 for the 338 considered the most needy
in the city’s public-health database.

It’s a waste of money, and a waste of lives.

A focus on chronic homelessness will require a considerable public
investment — perhaps starting with a bond measure of $200 million just
for new housing — but the long-term savings would be worth it. It also
will require a summoning of public will to overcome the inevitable
neighborhood resistance to construction of supportive housing for the
homeless in available spaces.

Pursuit of solutions to homelessness in San Francisco also demands a
change of mind-set in significant ways. One: This is not just a San
Francisco problem; it needs to be approached regionally, statewide, even
nationally. State Sen. Holly Mitchell, a Los Angeles Democrat, is on the
right track with SB1380, which would create a state Interagency Council
on Homelessness to identify and share best practices around the state.
The Legislature needs to pass SB1380 and move ahead with a proposed $2
billion homeless housing bond. San Francisco needs to work together with
Oakland and San Jose, which are experiencing their own struggles with
homelessness, to assure that they are not merely shifting the burden to
one another.

Also, San Francisco, which gets an influx of about 450 chronically
homeless people a year, needs to shed any perception that it is a
sanctuary for people who are unwilling to participate in programs
designed to get them off, and keep them off, a life in the streets. It
is neither inhumane nor “criminalizing poverty” to enforce laws against
aggressive panhandling, tent encampments or defecation and urination in
public places. It would be a colossal waste of money to make the
necessary investments in supportive housing and other services without a
commensurate commitment to assure that the people who are offered this
array of assistance are no longer afforded the option to flout the law
with impunity.

This is San Francisco’s challenge of the times. There could be no
greater legacy to this era of unprecedented prosperity than to accompany
the resources and ingenuity it is bringing to the city with the will to
solve this untenable predicament of the human condition before our eyes
every day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On any given day there are an estimated 6,686 homeless adults in San
Francisco, according to a point-in-time count conducted by volunteers at
the end of January 2015. While that figure is the most widely circulated
estimate on the number of people living without shelter in the city,
other databases show as many as 10,000 people experienced homelessness
over the course the 2015-16 fiscal year. The true figure is most likely
even higher. See past Chronicle coverage
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/numbers/> for more on the
how many people are homeless, and the costs associated with the population.
