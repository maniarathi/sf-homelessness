On June 29, more than 30 Bay Area media organizations spanning radio,
print, online and television news will curate an unprecedented wave of
coverage about homelessness in San Francisco to inspire a public
dialogue and to urge local politicians to come up with impactful
solutions to this ongoing problem.

It's not often that journalists set aside their differences in order to
unify behind a shared purpose, so on the day that this special media
collaboration launches, INFORUM is proud to present a panel discussion
featuring several journalists who are involved in this important
project. You'll hear more about how this coordinated media campaign
started, what the journalists hope to accomplish through their efforts
and how they see the changing role of media in society.
