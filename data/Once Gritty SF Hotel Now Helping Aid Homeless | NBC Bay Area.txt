Among San Francisco’s many single-room occupancy hotels, SROs as they’re

it into a valuable resource in the city’s efforts to provide a leg-up

(Published Wednesday, June 29, 2016)

Among San Francisco's many single-room occupancy hotels, SROs as they're
known, the Civic Center Hotel at 12th and Market streets was among its
most notorious.

It was known as a haven for violence and drugs — long-time residents
recalled stabbings and even recalled a time when people would climb into
the building via the adjacent travel lodge. It got so bad San Francisco
City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued the former managers over the squalid
conditions.

"It was one of the worst hotels around," said Cash, a current resident
of the hotel who didn't want to reveal his last name. "This used to be
the crank hotel. This used to be, all the speed used to come through here."

renovated as a "navigation" center to help homeless transition into
housing.

Still, the hotel was viewed as a step-up from the streets for many of
the city's homeless denizens. It was at the very least, a roof. But now
the hotel has undergone a transformation turning it into a valuable
resource in the city's efforts to provide a leg-up for homeless trying
to transition into stable lives.

The city contracted with the Community Housing Partnership to take over
management of the hotel. CHP group changed janitorial services and
upgraded bathrooms. But the most profound change was to remodel old
downstairs storage rooms to accommodate new on-site centers offering
24-7 social services, meals and laundry to the roughly 100 residents who
will occupy the building.

"The folks who have been living on the streets, predictably in
encampments, need a period where they really stabilize," said Gail
Gilman, CHP's executive director.

building. He described it as once one of the "worst hotels around."

The services offered in the hotel will mirror those available in the
city's nearby "navigation center," an all-in-one service center that
combines temporary housing with on-site social services. City leaders
have touted the navigation program as an effective and popular tool
toward transitioning people off the streets.

Nicole Johnson, who estimates she's been homeless for 25 years, was
looking forward to the new version of the Civic Center Hotel.

"They'll keep a roof over my head, they're putting in a kitchen,"
Johnson said. "I think it'll help get a lot more people off the streets."

notorious SRO Hotels. It's now being remade as a "navigation" service
center to help homeless people transition off the streets.

The city said the new facility will create more spaces for people trying
to get into the city's one current navigation center. The waits have
frustrated homeless who are trying to transition off the streets.

"Every time I try to get in it's booked," said Ryan Palmer, a homeless
man living in an encampment near Mission Bay.

Though the hotel's future will be an improvement over its past, it will
be a somewhat temporary one. The building is slated for demolition in a
couple years as part of a swath of new development in the pipeline west
from Van Ness Avenue. But CHP plans to replace the hotel with a new
building that will house 100 formerly-homeless. The current residents of
the Civic Center Hotel will relocate to the new building once it's built.

The city is pushing to open six more navigation centers to help people
seeking an avenue off the streets. Cash, the current Civic Center Hotel
resident gave a conditional thumbs-up to the new role for the
formerly-dodgy building.

"That might be ok if they can direct us to where we can get services,"
Cash said, "instead of just putting us up in a hotel until we get ready
to go back on the streets."
