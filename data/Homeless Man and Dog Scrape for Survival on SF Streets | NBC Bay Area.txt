Every day Shawn scrapes up enough money for food and maybe a few
cigarettes. He beds down at night in the streets in the South of Market
area. He runs the figures: even if someone earned $900 a month it would
be impossible to afford an apartment in the vastly expensive city. Joe
Rosato reports. (Published Wednesday, June 29, 2016)

There was a time when Shawn, the only name he reveals, was chasing a
life of angry young dreams. He traveled the country following punk rock
bands — immersed in a life of buzzing guitars, drugs and mosh pits.
Eventually only the drugs remained — as his life spiraled into the
streets in a blaze of homelessness where he remains.

Most mornings, Shawn can be found on a corner of a South of Market
intersection holding a cardboard sign and chatting up anyone and
everyone in hopes of inspiring a donation. His mother was a junkie, he
said — family structure was never part of his life.

As if revealing a deep dark secret, Shawn leaned in, his voice dropping
into a cigarette-blackened timbre to make a revelation; "Tell you the
truth," Shawn said, "I hate being homeless. It's not a very fun thing."

Shawn panhandles in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood. He
says he makes a few dollars each day to buy food. “Tell you the truth,”
he says, “I hate being homeless. It’s not a very fun thing.”

Shawn has tried to get off the streets. He spent a year-and-a-half in
the dodgy Civic Center Hotel, which he hoped would lead to permanent
housing. When the housing didn't materialize, he landed back outside.

Last Spring he got an opportunity to move into San Francisco's temporary
Pier 80 shelter. But the day he was to move in, his social phobia kicked in.

"Just going through the whole fences with the barbed wire and all that,
I was like, 'I gotta go.' I couldn't handle it," he recalled. "I was
feeling like I was getting sent to a concentration camp or something."

He struggled with depression over his situation, a bottomless pit of
despair with no ladder out. But then one day two years ago, a friend who
worked on Caltrain came across a small hungry beat-up dog on the train.

"He looked so pathetic," Shawn said, "I said this is my dog."

It's hard to say who rescued who. Shawn nursed the dog back to health on
food that was either donated or purchased with his panhandling proceeds.
But in the process, it was Shawn who was nursed back to health.

"Then I got him and I started having responsibility," Shawn said, as his
dog Ocito lounged in the shade of a nearby building. "Everybody I know,
like my old friends, they say since I've gotten this dog I've changed a
lot."

Shawn and his dog Octo hang out on a South of Market intersection. Shawn
took in the abandoned dog at a time when Shawn was battling depression.
He says the dog saved his life.

But Shawn's situation hasn't changed. Every day he scrapes up enough
money for food and maybe a few cigarettes. He beds down at night in the
streets in the South of Market area. He runs the figures: even if
someone earned $900 a month it would be impossible to afford an
apartment in the vastly expensive city.

"If they don't build subsidy housing," Shawn said, "there's no way
homeless people are going to get off the streets."

After several hours panhandling on the corner of Howard and 9th Streets,
Shawn had earned exactly one dollar and a salad, which he eyed warily.
He collected up his backpack and called to Ocito and started walking
down the sidewalk — searching for a better spot with more possibilities.
