San Francisco
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/related-entities/?eid=48265&ename=San%20Francisco&lang=en>
voters may see dueling homeless tent encampment measures on the November
ballot.

Last week, Supervisor Mark Farrell
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/related-entities/?eid=1523949965&ename=Mark%20Farrell&lang=en>
sparked controversy by placing on the ballot a measure that would ban
homeless tent encampments
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/san-francisco-voters-may-ban-homeless-encampments/>
and authorize The City to remove them within 24-hour notice after
offering shelter.

Homeless advocates and progressive leaders denounced the initiative as
further criminalizing the homeless and political – similar to the 2010
campaign to ban sitting or lying on public sidewalks.

Supervisor Aaron Peskin
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/related-entities/?eid=3083244971&ename=Aaron%20Peskin&lang=en>
introduced Tuesday a counter to that measure after giving a lengthy
speech aimed at Farrell’s measure during the Board of Supervisors meeting.

Peskin’s counter ballot measure — Tuesday was the deadline to submit
November ballot measures — would create a process for the removal of
encampments under existing laws.

The City would need to provide a 72-hour notice — two days longer than
Farrell’s measure requires — before removing an encampment.

Peskin’s measure also has a more detailed housing plan for those
displaced from encampments.

“We know that currently there is one shelter bed for every five and a
half homeless people in our city and we have over 800 people waiting for
shelter,” Peskin said in the speech.

Like Farrell’s measure, Peskin requires The City to offer shelter to
anyone displaced from removed encampments. But Peskin’s goes further by
stipulating that the offered housing must remain available to the person
for 24 hours after the encampment was removed.

And once they are placed in a shelter, The City must within 30 days
create a plan to relocate the person from the shelter bed into long term
housing. The City must guarantee a shelter bed during those 30 days as
well.

Farrell placed his measure on the November ballot last week, using the
process of four signatures from members of the board. Supervisors Scott
Wiener, Malia Cohen and Katy Tang supported it.

Peskin would need six votes by Aug. 5 from the board to place the
measure on the November ballot.

Should both win voter approval in November, the measure with the most
votes prevails.
