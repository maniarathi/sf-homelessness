With longtime Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates completing what he says will be
his last term, six people have expressed interest in running for his
seat come November 2016
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/election-2016-berkeley/>. Berkeleyside
asked each of them to share their views, in 200 words, about what they
see as potential solutions to ending homelessness. Read their ideas below.

election later in the year. Responses appear below in the order they
were received.

It is of great concern to me and all Citizens of Berkeley that despite
spending $3 million dollars in the last fiscal year the homeless
population has mushroomed by 53%. No one including the current city
council has publicly stated why this has occurred.

The current system is broken based on either criminalization or charity
because there is no strategic plan. My focus is to provide a hand up and
not a hand out.

Recently I sent two proposals to City Council which will immediately
reduce the homeless population by 20%. The first deals with re purposing
West Berkeley Senior Center. Converting it into a shelter for 100
homeless elders. The cost to the taxpayer is $1.25 a year. It will also
provide others emergency shelter during the winter months. Secondly
creating a bunkhouse shelter for the working poor at a zero cost. Both
of these are in addition to the Tiny House proposal which I initiated.
This exciting strategy promises to instantaneously reduce the population
even further.

In order to solve this problem we must include the expert opinion of the
homeless themselves. When you need a tooth pulled do you go to an expert
or an auto mechanic?

<http://www.laurieforberkeleymayor.com/>

Homelessness is a multifaceted problem that includes populations with
complex needs. Homelessness is also a regional issue, one in which we
must partner with our regional colleagues. My long term approaches include:

Homeless Coordinated Entry or “HUB”: a one­stop entry for mental health
services, temporary financial support, substance abuse programs and job
training which opened in January, 2016.

Supportive Housing in the Downtown: I support the Berkeley Food and
Housing and Bridge Foundation proposal for downtown Berkeley that will
house the HUB and provide emergency and supportive housing.

Tiny Homes: I am partnering with Mayoral candidate Mike Lee on a Tiny
Homes project. Supported by the Building Trades and Berkeley Rotary, we
will soon create a demonstration home to facilitate a community
conversation regarding the feasibility of a Tiny Home Village.

But long term solutions require stop­gap measures. I have supported
access to more restrooms in the downtown and the creation of storage
lockers which, at a minimum, can provide for a secure place for
Berkeley’s homeless to store their belongings.

We cannot solve this ourselves, but with our limited resources we can
serve our residents through innovative programs that can be models for
the rest of the Bay Area.

This is just an idea, but there might be a supervised campground by the
seashore that people can stay for a limited period. Homeless would need
to do chores. We also could build temp housing units with container
crates in the same region. Give homeless a chance to do productive
things that potential give them the skills to get jobs.

Gould: “The only real solution to chronic homelessness is housing.”

The only real solution to chronic homelessness is housing. Other cities,
including San Francisco, have found that proving housing with supportive
services works. It’s also cheaper than providing the services needed to
help people living on the street. Berkeley should work with other local
governments in the region to both expand our housing-first programs and
simultaneously build more subsidized affordable housing, to help keep
people from becoming homeless in the first place.

However, Berkeley also faces a unique situation with its homeless
student population. Undergraduates are almost all automatically
disqualified from federally subsidized affordable housing, and UC
Berkeley doesn’t currently provide housing for undergraduates after
their first year.

Both the City and the campus share a responsibility for ending
student homelessness. The university has an obligation to ensure its
students can attend, but the exceptionally high cost of living is the
result of our own zoning and other policies explicitly designed to raise
the price of housing. To ensure Cal students can afford to live where
they work, study, and play, the City should work with the university to
identify sites where more student housing can be built, and help
subsidize it for students who need the support.

Berkeley is facing a homelessness crisis, with over 1,000 people living
on our streets. The debate about how to address homelessness in our city
is nothing new. Some believe we need a one dimensional, criminalization
approach. But this approach fails to recognize the basic humanity of
people and will not solve the problem.

We need real solutions. That’s why I convened a Homeless Task Force to
look in depth at the issue of homelessness. The Task Force developed a
comprehensive homeless plan which can serve as a roadmap for Berkeley.

What we learned is that Housing First must be our priority. By getting
people housed we can provide services, case management and keep them
housed. But first we need to invest taxpayer dollars towards creating
more transitional and permanent housing.

We must also expand outreach, emergency mental health treatment, and
basic amenities like restrooms and storage so people don’t abuse public
spaces. More warming centers and emergency shelters are needed during
cold winter months.

I will be laying out my homeless plan in the coming weeks and look
forward to talking with Berkeley voters on this critical issue. Please
contact me at jesse@jesse.vote <mailto:jesse@jesse.vote> to share your
views.

(Berkeleyside did not receive a response from candidates Naomi Pete or
Zachary Running Wolf.)
