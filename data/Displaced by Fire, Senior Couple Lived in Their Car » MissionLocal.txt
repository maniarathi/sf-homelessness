  Displaced by Fire, Senior Couple Lived in Their Car

When fire destroyed Fernando and Carmen Chamorro’s home of twelve years
above the Palace Steakhouse on Mission Street near Cesar Chavez street,
Fernando already knew what was coming, predicting that tenants would
likely be out of a home for a year or more awaiting renovations.

“It’s inevitable,” he said at the time
<http://missionlocal.org/2015/12/early-morning-fire-in-sf-mission-displaces-10/>,
“because the fire was through the roof.”

He did not expect that six months later, he and his wife would have
spent months living in their car.

“So we are worse than before. Still in the car,” he said in early June.
“No bathroom, no room, no nothing”

Mission Pie In Story <javascript:void(0)>

The Chamorros have been to single-resident occupancy hotels and are
applying for housing. The shared bathroom at the SRO gave Fernando a
foot fungus, and the housing applications haven’t panned out yet.
Finding something on the open market is out of the question. Instead,
they are waiting out the time for the renovations on their damaged
apartment to be complete — possibly by December.

“We both worked, retired with insurance and me, from a union, but it’s
so expensive we cannot get anything,” Chamorro said. “Market price is so
high.”

He’s even become involved politically, seeking help from Supervisor
David Campos. In April, he appeared in a press conference
<http://missionlocal.org/2016/04/new-fire-legislation-would-require-landlords-to-communicate-after-fires/comment-page-1/>called
by Campos to support new fire legislation that would require better
communication from landlords to the city after a fire.

Eventually, disappointed by the supervisor’s inability to find him and
his wife a permanent place to stay, Chamorro abandoned that course of
action.

Ben Amyes, who helps those displaced by disasters find a place to stay
through the city’s Human Services Agency, remembered the Chamorros.

“Because they were seniors, they were my highest priority,” he said.

He referred them to services in Spanish, where it transpired that the
Chamorros had purchased renters’ insurance.

“We referred them out to another agency to let us know that they were
working with them, and they did, in fact have insurance. So they were
supposed to have been using their insurance,”Amyes said.

Alicia Sandoval, who helps tenants through the Housing Rights Coalition,
explained the couple is in communication with their insurance provider
and has been provided some assistance in paying for a hotel, but that
it’s unclear how long the hotel stay will last.

Some of the temporary housing options Chamorro explored, particularly
SROs, also came with a different problem: Shared bathrooms, drug addict
neighbors, and filthy conditions felt like a punishment he didn’t deserve.

“We are good, hard working people,” Chamorro said. “We don’t belong there.”

With that and the option of assistance from renters’ insurance
exhausted, Amyes said it was time to step back.

“I can show them the way, but if they choose not to go there, one of the
hardest lessons about being a social worker is you can’t want it more
than your client,” he said.

Aid workers often emphasize that the refusal of services is exceedingly
rare among homeless individuals. But when the service offered does not
meet the need, no amount of goodwill will solve the problem. In this
case, as with many homeless individuals, the main need is to find or
return to a place that can truly be called home.

“I have not met anyone in my years of doing this work that if gave him a
set of keys for adequate housing that they would turn it down,” said
Kelley Cutler, an outreach worker with the Coalition on Homelessness, in
a recent interview about services available to the homeless.

But many, she said, no longer believe that anything offered will fulfill
their need: “If you dig a little deeper, a lot of people have given up
hope for any change or to be helped.”

For the Chamorros, at least, the situation in the car may be bleak, but
not all hope is lost. They have heard from their landlord that the
renovations, which Amyes said should not be very extensive, should be
complete in December — at which point they should be able to return home.

    If they are both retired with some benefits, why not move somewhere
    more affordable? Certainly this has to be better than living out of
    your car in San Francisco. I get that community is important, but
    you have to draw the line somewhere and move if you need to.
