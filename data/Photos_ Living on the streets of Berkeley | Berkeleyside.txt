Walk down any street in Berkeley, from the shores of the Marina up to
the UC Berkeley campus, and chances are good you will spot someone
living on the street. Sometimes they are sleeping. Sometimes they are
playing music. Sometimes they are panhandling. On occasion, they are
protesting.

<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/berkeley-homeless-project/>*.*

Berkeleyside has gathered portraits and pictures of the city’s homeless
in a photo essay we hope shows a range of experiences people living on
the street have.

left, he said. Photo: Frances Dinkelspiel
