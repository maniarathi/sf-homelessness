  Talking to children about homeless: Keep it simple, compassionate

It’s obvious from all the squabbling at City Hall and the confusion
among residents that adults have a hard time processing the city’s
confounding homeless problem.

So how in the world do we explain it to our kids? After all, a San
Francisco childhood comes with passing by tent encampments, panhandlers
and people sprawled in doorways on a regular basis. And unlike
calamities such as war, natural disasters and the Republican
presidential campaign, there’s no off switch for the sad news unfolding
right outside our doors.

Farrell
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Mark+Farrell%22>*,
recently penned a column in the Marina Times about the subject. Now that
major development projects in the South of Market have rousted longtime
homeless campers, they’re more visible in all corners of the city — and
even more obvious to curious kids.

“Soccer practices, playgrounds, walking down Chestnut Street, you’re not
immune from it anywhere,” she said.

*Keep message simple*

On an outing to Safeway with her 3-year-old the other day, the boy
noticed a mentally ill homeless person and said, “Mom, that man is scary.”

“There’s a way to explain that to a 3-year-old versus how I talk to my
10-year-old about it,” she said. “I said, ‘I think he’s having a hard
time. You know sometimes when you’re having a hard time and you yell or
scream? I think that’s what he’s doing.’ I think it’s important to keep
the message simple, but also very honest.”

Farrell, like other parents and childhood development experts we talked
to, recommended keeping explanations short, straightforward and
compassionate.

“Parents always tend to say too much,” agreed *Betsy Brown Braun
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Betsy+Brown+Braun%22>*,
a child development and behavior specialist. “You take the kids’
questions as they come, and you answer them as minimally but as
factually as you can without creating more anxiety. It’s always
accompanied by the reassurance that our family is fine, and we have
enough money to be in a home.”

Explaining about someone lying on the street can center on the person
not having enough money for a home, she said. And explaining mental
illness can center on likening it to injuries in other body parts.

“His brain is not working the way it’s supposed to work,” she suggested
saying.

*Volunteer project*

Explanations get easier and more complete, of course, as kids get older.
And for San Francisco teens, it can prove an interesting academic subject.

At San Francisco Friends School
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22San+Francisco+Friends+School%22>,
a private K-8 academy in the Mission, the eighth-grade class chooses a
service learning project to delve into for the year. This year, the
teens are studying homelessness.

They spoke at a hearing on the issue at City Hall, held a rally outside
the Capitol building in Sacramento, volunteered at St. Anthony’s and
toured the Tenderloin with a guide who was formerly homeless. They also
walked through the Division Street camp handing out sandwiches before
the mayor ordered it dismantled.

“It was strange that the number of homeless people in one block can
change and the mood of a city block can change because of that,” said
*Sam Ludeke
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Sam+Ludeke%22>*,
14. “On one block there’s a stylish restaurant and then tents with jars
of urine.”

Sounds like San Francisco, all right.

The teens all grew up in the city and said they remember feeling
unsettled as little kids passing by homeless people.

“You shouldn’t ignore them because that’s rude, but you shouldn’t
interact with them as a 5-year-old because it’s not safe,” said *Eloise
Burtis
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Eloise+Burtis%22>*,
13. “I tried to shut it out for a really long time.”

Burtis said now that she understands homelessness better, she tries to
acknowledge everybody she passes.

“Figuring out a way to balance your emotions with sympathy for people in
that situation is a really important thing to do,” she said. “Even if
it’s just a smile, it’s something.”

For *Marjan Philhour*, a political consultant who’s running for
supervisor in the Richmond District, talking about homelessness with her
three children is personal. Her husband’s father, who is now dead, used
to live in Golden Gate Park and suffered from mental illness.

“Our kids have asked about it, and we’re always sure to talk about it as
something that could happen to any of us,” Philhour said.

*Doniece Sandoval * is the founder of the mobile shower program for
homeless people called Lava Mae. She said her daughter, now 9, started
noticing homeless people in their Western Addition neighborhood when she
was 4. She even asked why a man living in his car couldn’t move in with
them.

“I told her it was a really beautiful idea, but that he needed more
support,” Sandoval said, adding they did bring the man blankets and food.

Sandoval said she thinks the most important thing is to model
compassion. In a time when people ignore pretty much everybody they pass
— homeless or not — it’s kinder to smile and say hello.

“I think you should have a conversation, starting with empathy,” she
said. “If this was us, what would we want? What would be our highest
hope for how people would treat us?”

*Nadine Agosta
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Nadine+Agosta%22>*,
a lecturer in child development at San Francisco State University
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22San+Francisco+State+University%22>,
said empathy should be followed up by problem solving.

“What do you think we could do — as a group or as a classroom or as a
family?” she suggested asking. “Do something good and help people.”

A lesson for kids — and City Hall — alike.

*Suggestions from parents **and child development experts*

**

Age matters: Until kids are about 6, talk to them about homelessness
only if they bring it up. Keep the explanations short and
straightforward. Admit if you don’t know the answer, then try to find it.

Model compassion: Look homeless people in the eye and say hello. Giving
money to panhandlers is a personal decision, but several people
interviewed said they carry hygiene kits or warm socks to hand out
instead. Have kids donate presents to shelters at the holidays, or
volunteer.

Offer reassurance: Tell children their family and home are secure — if
that’s the truth. Never tell a child he or she could end up like the
homeless person you pass if they don’t do their homework or misbehave.

Mental illness: If you pass a person who is ranting and raving, offer
your child a chance to ask questions. Liken it to another physical
injury or illness by saying the person’s brain isn’t working the way
it’s supposed to.
