  New Homeless Czar Jeff Kositsky Pens Chronicle Credo

by Caleb Pershan <http://sfist.com/author/Caleb%20Pershan> in News

/

As a day of devoted homelessness coverage draws to a close — though
there will be more articles to come this this week and for many more to
come — heads might naturally turn to Jeff Kositsky, the new Department
of Homelessness and Supportive Housing director. Kositsky was previously
the executive director of the Hamilton Family Center and has been
tasked, to some degree, with harnessing the power of the tech purse to
aid the mayor in his pledge to house 8,000 people by the end of his term
<http://sfist.com/2016/05/31/sfs_new_homelessness_department_hea.php>.

Now he's received the San Francisco Magazine profile treatment
<http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-mayor-of-tent-city>, from
which we learn that the 50-year-old almost died in a skiing accident
just before taking the job. Also, just before that, he got a tattoo of a
flying pig, for whatever reasons one might do such a thing.

Waxing a bit conspiratorial, the magazine asks if Kositsky is "being set
up to fail," and by that they mean that "In the end, the one thing that
would truly solve the homelessness crisis is one thing that Kositsky has
severely limited ability to control: the acquisition of sufficient
housing."

Kositsky seems upbeat, andhe's lent his voice to the Chronicle today
<http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/How-SF-will-re-envision-integrate-its-8330631.php?t=a6db874c06baa6eec6&cmpid=twitter-premium>
to give us a sense of what his direction and job will be. His position
will be one unifying existing programs, and he says we don't have to
"reinvent the wheel."

First off, Kositsky makes the point that many people have been housed in
San Francisco under our umbrella of services and that the numbers of
people experiencing homelessness here aren't going up, which is good and
not always the case in other cities.

    I intend to build off successful program models and system designs
    from communities that have achieved significant progress. We do not
    need to reinvent the wheel but rather bring together all that works
    into a local coordinated system to align our shelter and housing
    resources.

    Moving to a truly integrated navigation system will involve
    re-examining our entire organization to address homelessness. The
    cornerstone is the use of system-wide priorities and data to match
    people in crisis with the right housing intervention based on their
    needs. The pillars of an integrated system include:

• Building on the success of the navigation center model.

• Creating a cross-departmental team to address encampments throughout
the city.

• Streamlining access and referral to services and housing.

• Ensuring that all people experiencing a housing crisis have fair and
equal access.

• Using standardized tools and practices.

• Incorporating a system-wide “housing-first” approach to all types of
programs.

• Prioritizing homeless assistance for those with the greatest needs.

• Using a common data system to track services and outcomes across the
system of care.

In closing, Kositsky calls the problem of homelessness "solvable" and
asks for help from elected officials and the public. "I am often told
that I will have to walk a fine line between compassion and common
sense," he writes, "but I see it as a wide boulevard."

Finally, just a small observation on Kositsky grabbing the mic from the
Chron at this particular moment: It's impossible not to get a sense that
the Chronicle and City Hall have synchronized watches or something.
Consider also that yesterday the second Homeless Navigation center
"opened,
<http://sfist.com/2016/06/29/second_homeless_navigation_center_o.php>"
(some beds have been in use for months). Of course City Hall is aware of
the media effort and doesn't want to be observed doing nothing, so it
makes sense.
