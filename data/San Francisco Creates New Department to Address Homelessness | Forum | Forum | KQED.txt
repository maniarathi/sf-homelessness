tents set up on San Francisco's Division Street	

This Friday, the city of San Francisco will launch a new Department
of Homelessness and Supportive Housing with Jeff Kositsky at the
helm. Kositsky, who has advocated for homeless rights for more than
twenty years, most recently headed the Hamilton Family Center,
an emergency shelter for homeless families. We’ll talk with Kositsky
about his priorities as the department’s inaugural director, including
the city’s goal of establishing six navigation centers to serve homeless
around the city in the next two years.


      *Interview Highlights*

*On a Unified Strategy to Address Homelessness*

“We need to have a unified city strategy on how we want to address 
homelessness, not, you know, 60 different non-profit organizations all
working to achieve their very honorable and important missions. But the
city needs to decide: this is what we wanna do, these are the number of
shelter beds we need, this is the number of housing units we need, this
is our expectation around outcomes and success for people exiting
shelters or people staying in housing, and then we need to drive our
resources towards programs that meet the city’s strategy and the city’s
priorities.”

*On Encampments*

“The mayor and I, and I think most people in San Francisco agree that
encampments are not a healthy, safe or appropriate place for homeless
people to stay. They are dangerous, there’s a high rate of sexual
assault and crime. I also think that it’s important to recognize that
people who live around the encampments and the businesses around the
encampments also suffer from fear, from uncertainty, from disruptions of
their lives. …We are actually going to be announcing today the creation
of a special encampment response team that’s going to be led by Jason
Albertson, who was a longtime member of the [Homeless Outreach Response
Team] and has worked closely with law enforcement in other counties.

“I’m not particularly worried or thinking about ballot measures or what
the board of supervisors may or may not do in November”
Jeff Kositsky, Director, Department of Homelessness and Supportive
Housing for the City and County of San Francisco


*On the Upcoming Election and Ballot Measures*

“I’m not particularly worried or thinking about ballot measures or what
the board of supervisors may or may not do in November. The mayor and I
are just staying focused on good policy, trying to address the issue. I
think ultimately, I hope, that good policy is what will be the best
politics around the issue of homelessness.”

* On Street Crime*

“People conflate street crime with homelessness and it’s often not the
case. … I don’t believe Supervisors [Scott] Wiener or [Mark] Farrell are
looking for a crackdown on homeless people or expect the police to crack
down on homeless folks. What they’re trying to do is find ways to
enforce existing laws that are more effective, to make sure our
neighborhoods are safer. … I don’t believe there is very much benefit to
giving somebody a ticket because they’re sleeping on the street because
they have nowhere else to go. However, I do believe if people are out on
the streets breaking laws – that that needs to be, needs to be addressed.

*On Permanent Housing*

“I think we should really drive our investments towards permanent
solutions to homelessness, like the Rapid Rehousing Program or permanent
housing. Shelter and transitional housing only solves the problem of
sleep; housing is what is going to solve homelessness.”
