More from the SF Homeless Project <http://sfist.com/tags/sfhomelessproject>:

  * A look at how the issue of homelessness has been addressed by the
    local business community, and how it impacts local business
    <http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/06/29/s-f-homeless-project-business.html?ana=RSS%26s=article_search>
    (especially tourism) via the [SF Business Times].
  * A formerly homeless woman and columnist for [48 Hills] discusses how
    normal life can become "scary"
    <http://48hills.org/2016/06/28/for-homeless-people-normal-life-becomes-scary/>
    after living on the streets, and how she's tired of hearing "the
    same media-makers, who as my mama Dee used to say 'have never missed
    a meal,'" reporting on the problem from the outside.
  * Also, [NBC Bay Area] takes a broad look at the problem
    <http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Nearly-7000-People-in-San-Francisco-Live-Without-a-Home-384739921.html>,
    and speaks to one homeless man in an encampment near some new,
    expensive condos, who says he's gotten accustomed to living a
    non-traditional live outdoors. "Sometimes I look at these people
    going in these condos, and say 'you're trapped and I'm not."
  * The [Examiner] pays a visit to one of the bimonthly service fairs
    from Project Homeless Connect
    <http://www.sfexaminer.com/searching-solutions-project-homeless-connect/>,
    which started under the Newsom administration, and which still
    provides personal as well as medical and legal services to the
    homeless.
  * And [BuzzFeed] does its thing: Here's a choose-your-own-adventure
    style take
    <https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/can-you-find-a-place-to-sleep-tonight?utm_term=.bupNl97r5#.xhl2nb50d>
    on being homeless and finding a place to sleep in SF. 


Also:

  * There's been a sudden rash of vandalism
    <http://sf.curbed.com/2016/6/29/12060092/stern-grove-arson-crime> at
    Stern Grove that's left picnic benches smashed and burnt. [Curbed]
  * Uh, what the fuck is this Heterosexual Pride Day bullshit
    <https://news.google.com/news/more?ncl=dDCGE10aAqa9nWMooRDARGz3W0t2M&authuser=0&ned=us&topic=h>?
    Fuck that. [Google]
  * Don't feel old enough? It was nine years ago today
    <http://www.cnet.com/news/my-all-nighter-with-the-first-iphone/#ftag=CAD590a51e>
    that the first iPhone went on sale. [CNet]
  * These iconic Page Street mosaic murals
    <http://hoodline.com/2016/06/page-street-s-mosaic-murals-still-seeking-home-may-be-destroyed>
    may be destroyed. [Hoodline]
  * An update from the PG&E San Bruno trial: A witness says
    <http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/PG-E-kept-faulty-pipeline-records-witness-says-8332859.php>
    it was "commonly" known around PG&E that it kept poor records on its
    gas pipelines. [SF Gate]
  * Inspectors found 1,564 housing code violations
    <http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/06/29/san-francisco-mission-district-fires-housing-code-violations>
    in more than 150 residential buildings in San Franciscoâ€™s Mission
    District during the 2014-15 fiscal year. [KQED]
