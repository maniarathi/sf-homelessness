  You Wouldn’t Guess, But I Was Homeless Once.


    So maybe the next time a homeless person tries talking to you,
    just listen.

I’ve spent a big chunk of the last couple of months working on a scheme
that came to fruition this week: the SF Homeless Project
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/>. So far more than 70
outlets have run more than 200 stories on the background and potential
solutions to San Francisco’s homelessness epidemic—something like 80 of
them here on Medium <http://sfhomelessproject.com/>, and the others out
elsewhere on the web. It’s quite astonishing to see.

Of course, everyone who took part in this knows it’s not perfect. We
know talking about it is only one early part of dealing with the
situation, and we know that as media organizations—as citizens of this
city—we can all do more. But it’s a start.

For my part, I concentrated on two things: Creating a space for
publishers to collaborate more effectively, and on making sure the
unmediated voices of homeless people were actually heard. So I worked
with Darcel Jackson <https://medium.com/u/2e43f7014eb8> to help tell his
story
<https://sfhomelessproject.com/they-really-messed-up-a-lot-of-people-you-know-75d2d6cd4275#.2ldus5ta6>,
and with my co-worker Madison Kahn <https://medium.com/u/d839f9863fc6>
to run workshops that helped members of the Downtown Streets Team
<http://streetsteam.org/> share their stories—people like Lisa
<https://sfhomelessproject.com/i-thank-god-for-not-giving-up-on-me-even-if-i-gave-up-on-myself-a08b0929157c#.7wbujmnk4>,

Oscar
<https://sfhomelessproject.com/im-not-69-for-nothin-48aa5391f3d5#.5jgvw5tcx>,
as well as others we’ll be releasing soon. Not everybody wanted to take
part (so… they didn’t), but for those who chose to share, the experience
has proven cathartic, powerful, and supportive.

Hearing their voices was vitally important to me, but not just because
they’re the ones really enduring this ongoing crisis. I also had a deep
personal connection: I was homeless myself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the late 1980s, my parents—young, working class, living in public
housing—found themselves enjoying an economic boom. Things were going
well, money was coming in, and so we did what the world tells everybody
to do, and bought our own house.

It wasn’t long before disaster struck. In 1990, a recession kicked in,
jobs disappeared, interest rates went sky high, and my mum and dad were
left not only with a mortgage they couldn’t pay but negative equity too.
We moved out in the hope of renting our home to somebody who might cover
the bills, but it wasn’t enough.

So we couch-hopped, scrambled, stayed with relatives, but the stress and
cramped conditions were tough. My family is a sprawling, chaotic bunch
of English council estate characters, and my grandfather died around the
same time, putting a pretty unbearable strain on everyone. We couldn’t
stay long anywhere, and for a while we even moved back into the empty
house we’d been forced out of, essentially camping out in the shell of
our old life. In the end, though, nothing was enough. My parents went
bankrupt, and after a while we were placed in public housing again. I
really don’t remember how long it took, but it felt like forever.
(Update: My mum says it was about a year.)

As a pre-teen at the time, my recollections are, thankfully, very fuzzy
(My mum’s typically-understated description was that this was “topsy
turvy.”) But I do remember that the whole situation was constantly
confusing, unpredictable and deeply shameful. What did I say to the
other kids at school? Why couldn’t my friends come round to play any
more? Why was I sleeping in somebody else’s bedroom?

I don’t blame my parents. I don’t blame my family. I blame a system that
tells poor people to get themselves into debt but doesn’t teach them how
to plan for the future. And sometimes these things just go wrong.

So, when we started working on SFHP, when I started really listening to
the stories of people who had lived on the streets—of hardship, of tough
decisions, of choosing a shitty road because the /other/ road was even
worse—I could see how you get there, and how desperate you are. How
people forget that it’s not about dereliction, it’s about disaster. I
thought back to my hometown, and the invisible homelessness we suffered,
and I thought of the secret we carried around with us, the way it has
changed my outlook on life.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, the next time a homeless person stops you in the street, or when you
think about the ways you’re annoyed by it, just take a moment.

There are people all around you who have had troubles. Maybe it’s mental
health issues, or physical problems. Maybe it’s financial strife, or
addiction, or family struggles that left them in a place they didn’t
want to be. There are people all around you who have been closer to the
brink than you might know—and maybe those who went over the edge are
much more like you than you realize.

This is a great article; having been homeless myself I really connect
with it.

But the depressing part about my experience was that I was a 21 year old
woman who was constantly preyed upon by men offering assistance. I’ve
been offered a place to stay just to wake up to a penis in my face or a
middle aged man spooning me…
