Jerry Brown signs $122 billion state budget without a single veto
1 / 4
Back to Gallery

SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown signed a $122 billion state budget on
Monday that puts $3.3 billion in the state’s rainy-day fund — $2 billion
more than constitutionally required — to bring the reserve to $6.7 billion.

And notably, the governor did not use his authority to tweak the budget
that had passed the state Legislature earlier this month. The last time
a governor did not veto a single item in the budget was the 1982-83
budget, when Brown was at the helm the first time.

The 2016-17 state budget <http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/> sends $71.9
billion to K-12 schools and community colleges, which is the highest
amount sent to schools under the state’s minimum funding guarantee. Per
student spending in K-12 schools increased to $10,643, which is up
$3,600 since 2011-12.

The state will spend $3.6 billion in state and federal money toward
affordable housing and homelessness programs. That includes $400 million
Assembly Democrats sought for affordable housing programs. That money
will be set aside until the Legislature and Brown reach a deal on the
governor’s calls for streamlining development projects.

Brown wants to streamline the review process for housing proposals that
meet a city’s zoning requirements, but the legislation has been opposed
by unions and other groups that say it sidesteps the state’s
environmental laws.

The state will authorize a $2 billion bond from future Proposition 63
mental health revenues to create affordable housing programs for the
mentally ill.

The budget included Democrats’ long-sought repeal of a controversial
limit on welfare benefits.

The “maximum family grant” does not allow for increased welfare payments
if a child is born after a family has already been receiving benefits.

Repealing the law is expected to cost $110 million in 2016-17. Democrats
sought the repeal for several years, saying the cap on welfare payments
endangers the health of infants born into poverty and intentionally
delves into the reproductive decisions of poor women.

“This balanced, on-time budget — which also responsibly grows the
state’s rainy day fund — is the result of hundreds of hours of public
hearings,” Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, D-Paramount (Los Angeles
County), said in a statement.

“That shows the budget process is working and our final product means
California is in stronger fiscal shape than we have been for years.”
