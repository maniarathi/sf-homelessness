  48% Of SF Homeless Youth Are LGBTQ And More Homeless News

Today's the big day more than 70 San Francisco media outlets have been
waiting for
<http://sfist.com/2016/06/27/sf_homeless_project_kicks_off_with.php>,
and as promised, there's a flood of coverage focused on the homeless
people of San Francisco, and beyond. For our own part, today we have
interviews with two former mayors of San Francisco, Senator Dianne
Feinstein and Art Agnos
<http://sfist.com/2016/06/29/former_mayors_dianne_feinstein_and.php>.
There you'll find thoughts on the situation during their mayoralties and
today as well as opinions — they have many — on policies that antedate
theirs. We also wrote about food security in the city, taking a look at
the various suppliers who keep as many homeless people fed as possible.
<http://sfist.com/2016/06/29/food_insecurity_in_the_city_of_food.php>

A hub for all this work from all the publications involved can be found
here <https://sfhomelessproject.com/>, and it reads like its own
dedicated news source on the subject. If you don't have a chance, at
least not at the moment, to peruse that on its own, below are some links
to particular stories that may capture your attention.

California Sunday magazine has a close look at four different
communities of young homeless people
<https://sfhomelessproject.com/young-homeless-san-francisco-5f9d450e4fc2#.u09v2vigr>,
48 percent of whom are LGBTQ in SF. The examination covers everything
from how these young people get around, or get here in the first place,
to what the things they carry with them.

Homeward Bound is the program that buses homeless San Franciscans out of
the city and to family and friends waiting for them with open arms, or
so the story goes. As more and more people take advantage of the
program, where is it all going, the Examiner asks
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-expanding-program-bused-10k-homeless-residents-town-past-decade/>?

What becomes of your property when you're homeless and face street
sweeps? The Examiner has a photo essay of those confiscated items that
are bagged and tagged
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/department-public-works-bagged-tagged-items-homeless/>.
And, over at Mission Local is a complementary look at the process of
trying to reclaim that stuff
<http://missionlocal.org/2016/06/property-of-san-francisco-homeless-routinely-disappeared-by-city/>
(it appears next to impossible).

Another side effect of encampments is waste, and surely there is
confusion about what is and isn't that. But looking at the situation
through the lens of 311 complaints and DPW removals, ABC7 has another
report
<http://abc7news.com/news/crews-remove-20000-tons-of-waste-from-sf-homeless-camps-weekly/1406362/>
citing 20,000 tons of waste being removed weekly from camps.

At least two publication braved the thorny question of supervised drug
and alcohol use. CityLab looks at the idea
<http://www.citylab.com/housing/2016/06/could-supervised-injection-help-san-franciscos-homeless-drug-users/489086/>,
which is very much just that for now, of safe injection sites, noting
arguments about the clandestine nature of shooting up that makes it
particularly unsafe. Meanwhile,ABC 7 is back on the question of an
alcohol-friendly "Wet House
<http://abc7news.com/news/could-wet-house-program-help-homeless-in-sf/1406047/>."
That includes this quote from Bevan Dufty, the former director or SF's
homeless programs, who's been advocating for one of these for five
years: "I think if you opened 75 to 100 units of wet housing... people
in the city would feel a difference, see a difference."

Mission Local had fielded a question I know many have asked: how do high
rents keep people or put people on our streets
<http://missionlocal.org/2016/06/high-rents-keep-sf-homeless-on-the-street-various-ties-keep-them-here/>?
Their approach was to gather stories of some who have stuck around due
to their ties to friends or work in the city, but who were fairly
recently housed here.

The Chronicle has yet another piece by Kevin Fagan
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/supportive-housing/>
exploring the supportive housing that San Francisco has built, the good
that it does, and discussing how much more may need to be built.

Last, in a totally immersive series of interviews, this KQED piece is
not to be missed
<http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/06/28/experience-life-on-the-streets-of-san-francisco-360-video>.
