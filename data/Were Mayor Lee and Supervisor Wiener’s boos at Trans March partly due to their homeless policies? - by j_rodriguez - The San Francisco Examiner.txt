  Were Mayor Lee and Supervisor Wiener’s boos at Trans March partly due
  to their homeless policies?

Jeez, I really wish I was keeping track of how many times Mayor Ed Lee
has been booed off stage in the last year. I can’t even really count
anymore — anyone have a guess?

Lee was booed at his inauguration, the labor council’s Martin Luther
King Day celebration, and at the vigil for Orlando shooting victims.

The latest heckle-fest was at this year’s Trans March on Friday at
Dolores Park.

In front of a parade of TV cameras, state Sen. Mark Leno was stymied as
a chorus of boos and hisses rose from the transgender community.

“I see you giving me the finger, that’s a very advanced and elevated
thing to do,” Leno said to the crowd just before someone mooned him.

Afterwards, some said Leno — who recently authored a law protecting
workplace rights of transgender employees — caught flak intended for Lee
and Supervisor Scott Wiener, who stood just behind him on stage.

“Mark Leno is a real ally. He’s the real deal,” one community member,
Ashley Love, said afterward. Lee and Wiener? Not so much, said Jordan
Gwendolyn Davis, a transgender advocate who also booed the politicians
Friday.

/Above, video of the heckling at Trans March. /

They partially earned those boos for their support of tent encampment
sweeps, she said. Sweeps are especially ineffective, since the waiting
list for local shelters is often 800 souls long.

Davis told On Guard that Wiener’s 2013 nighttime park closure
legislation also targeted the homeless, among other policies.

Wiener rebutted this critique of his record, and told me, “I support
helping all people get off the street and into housing and services.”

Lee’s spokesperson Deirdre Hussey said, “The mayor appreciates people
speaking up and expressing themselves” and noted the mayor earmarked
$1.2 million for the transgender community in The City’s budget this year.

Many transgender people experience homelessness, Davis said — including,
for years, herself.

“If you plan on ‘pink-washing’ your racial and economic injustice” at
Pride, Davis said, “you will be booed to the ends of the Earth.”

*Supervisor Malia Cohen just joined a long line of politicos* who’ve
reached their breaking point with political gadfly Michael Petrelis.

For those blissfully unaware of Petrelis (I’m so envious), he’s a
well-meaning advocate
<http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/petrelis-the-pest/Content?oid=2133012>
who touts his work in the gay community as an HIV-positive man. He
doggedly — and aggressively — investigates city government in his blog
“The Petrelis Files.”

He’s probably most infamous from his attempt to photograph Supervisor
Wiener urinating in a bathroom. Petrelis perfected trolling before
trolling was cool.

During a June 9 Rules Committee meeting to reappoint a member of the
Sunshine Task Force, Eric Eldon, editor of local newsblog Hoodline,
touted Petrelis’ (actually quite admirable) mission to compel city
officials to provide their public calendars.

Still, Cohen took issue with the kind words for The City’s top troll.

“Certainly there’s a way that you can request a calendar,” she asked
Eldon, “without being antagonistic, condescending, and overall, an
asshole. Wouldn’t you agree?”

Eldon replied the only way he could: “Certainly.”

*How long will Mayor Lee’s public opinion ratings remain in the tank?*
That was one among many questions pondered at the progressive meetup,
“How We Won and How We’ll Win in 2016: A Victory Party and Discussion”
in the Mission last Friday.

“I think Ed Lee has nowhere to go but up,” said political consultant Jim
Stearns, who sat on a panel of progressives.

He noted, “His staff seems to be dispirited, [they’re] not fighting as
hard as they used to.”

But he said Hussey, the new spokesperson for the Mayor’s Office, is “the
first step in building a new team, with new energy.”

And if Lee regains wind before November’s election, it could be key in
swinging the 6-5 progressive majority at the Board of Supervisors back
to the moderate camp.

*My column last week
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/9000-san-franciscans-voted-trump/> brought
the Trump-Franciscans out of the woodwork.* On Guard highlighted the
9,000 or so San Francisco voters for Republican nominee and lump-of-hate
Donald Trump.

Trump-lovers were peeved.

One said my map of Trump voters in The City was “hunting down” people
and was “disgusting, arrogant, and just plain Fascist [sic].”

To that, I’ll say geographic vote analysis is pretty common. Nothing new
there!

James Russell, a San Franciscan since 1984, wrote, “When Trump is
president, I’m sure his policies will provide more job opportunities for
you than Bernie or Hillary ever will.”

My favorite email came from a man named Will Campbell. The subject line
simply read “Your bias.”

Will wrote, “Every time I read you, I want to throw up!”

Thanks for reading, Will. Kindly send me your address, and I’ll mail you
a barf bag.
