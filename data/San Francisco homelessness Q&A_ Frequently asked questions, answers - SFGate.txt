We see homeless people every day pushing carts piled high with garbage
bags filled with everything they own. Now, we get to look inside and see
what's inside some of those bags. The last item Markael Raybon shows us
may surprise you.

/How can I help people experiencing homelessness? Should I give them
money? What should I do if a homeless person is sleeping on my doorstep
every night?/

The questions that arise around homelessness in San Francisco aren't
always easy ones and the answers can be quite complex. The most pressing
question of where to find a bed—whether you're looking for shelter
yourself or helping someone secure it—brings up a complicated system of
shelter shortages, long lines and waitlists.

Below we aim to provide responses to some of the most common questions. 

/*How many people are homeless in San Francisco?*/

According to the 2015 homeless count
<http://sfgov.org/lhcb/sites/default/files/2015%20San%20Francisco%20Homeless%20Count%20%20Report_0.pdf>, 6,686.

But really the number is elusive.

"Multiple government agencies have attempted to calculate the scope of
homelessness, but accurately measuring it or its social and economic
impacts is difficult, if not impossible," Joaquin Palomino writes in a
story for the San Francisco Chronicle
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/numbers/>. "Homelessness
can take many forms and is often a temporary status, making it hard to
reliably track."

Many people think the number is between 10,000 and 12,000.

San Francisco homelessness Q&A: Frequently asked questions, answers
1 / 36
Back to Gallery

/*How many are mentally ill?*/

An estimated one third of people who are homeless have mental illness,
according to the Mental Health Association of San Francisco
<http://mentalhealthsf.org/homelessness/>. Depression is the most common
disorder.

It's important to note that while many people become homeless because of
mental illness, the actual experience of being homeless can cause and
exacerbate mental illness. Studies show that even living on the street
for one week is traumatic and has negative affects on both the body and
mind. What's more, living on the street increases a person's chances of
being a victim of rape and hate crimes, which also negatively impact
one's mental state.

  * How to help: Season of Sharing

/*What's the definition of homeless?*/

For the count
<http://sfgov.org/lhcb/sites/default/files/2015%20San%20Francisco%20Homeless%20Count%20%20Report_0.pdf>,
anyone living in a temporary shelter or with a nighttime residence not
designed for sleeping — including a car, park, camping group, airport,
abandoned building, bus or train station — was considered homeless.

But Project Homeless Connect Executive Director Kara Zordel
<https://www.projecthomelessconnect.org/about/staff/>reminds us,
"Homelessness is an experience, it isn't a label [defining] a person.
Just like someone isn't cancer, it's a difficult experience. When we use
that word as a label, it makes it more difficult for someone to feel a
part of the community. No one is homeless. No one is AIDS. Homelessness
is an experience, not who a person is."

/*How many beds are there in shelters in the city?*/

The shelter system has 1,200—clearly not enough to provide housing for
the some 7,000 who are homeless.

"A homeless person can get a one-night emergency shelter bed quickly,"
as reported in a San Francisco Chronicle
<http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/What-San-Franciscans-know-about-homeless-isn-t-7224018.php>
article. "But anything else — supportive housing, longer-term shelter
beds, mental health care, substance abuse services — requires a waiting
list. If the waiting list is even taking new names. Some are so long,
they're closed."

What's more, "Not only are there too few shelters," Zordel says, "But
many don't feel safe — especially the nearly 30 percent of people
experiencing homelessness who are LGBT. So not only do we need more
housing, we need more safe spaces to keep our LGBT community
experiencing homelessness safe. Especially our transgender community."

/*Is it true that homeless people from other parts of the country are
coming to San Francisco for its services and benefits? */

The majority - 71 percent in the last count - became homeless while
living in San Francisco. This is due to a wide range of reasons, from
evictions to mental health issues.

In fact, only 1o percent said they were living outside California when
they became homeless in the last count, and of those, only 22 percent
came to the city for homeless services and benefits. 

"Other reasons for moving to San Francisco cited in the homeless count
were that they were looking for work, that they sought acceptance in the
gay community, that they were traveling through, or that family and
friends are here," as reported in the San Francisco Chronicle
<http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/What-San-Franciscans-know-about-homeless-isn-t-7224018.php>.
"In other words, the same reasons many of us came to San Francisco."

/*How can I help homeless people?*/

A good place to start is with empathy. It's easy to feel angry about the
people sleeping on the street and choose to not see them at all, but
what these people need is to feel like they're a part of the community.
Do something to show you care. From simply having a conversation and
offering a cup of coffee, to volunteering and donating money to
charities serving homeless people.

/*Should I give homeless people money?*/

When someone asks you for money on the street, an emotional tug-of-war
occurs between your intuition to help someone in need and your knowledge
that handing them a couple dollars might contribute to their suffering
rather than stop it.

It's commonly assumed that people living on the street ask for money to
purchase drugs and alcohol and this is true to some degree. The most
recent homeless count found that 37 percent of people who are homeless
struggle with drug or alcohol abuse. But in many cases, someone might be
asking for money for a bus fare, a cup of coffee or to feed a child, and
what you decide do is a personal decision.

Remember simple acts of kindness, such as offering a pair of socks or a
sandwich, go a long way.

That said, many experts say donations to charities over direct cash
handouts are best because what homeless people really need is services
and housing and these organizations can stretch your dollars and provide
that cup of coffee as well as healthcare, food and shelter.

/*Where can I volunteer?*/

Volunteering will not only change your perspective, it will let the
people experiencing homelessness known they aren't alone and their
community cares. Below is a list of local organizations to investigate.
Choose one that matches your philosophy.

/*What agencies should I donate to?*/

All of the organizations above appreciate monetary donations.

"I also love HandUp <https://handup.org/>," Zordel says. "Instead of
giving directly to someone who you don't know and perhaps don't want to
pull out your wallet, HandUp insures donations go directly to whomever
you choose and helps direct the funds toward vital items like food,
clothes, housing or work related items like training certificate etc.."

She adds: "It's not only a great way to give, it's a way of actually
connecting with the person experiencing homelessness as they must go to
an agency to redeem the money given. So not only do they know a person
cared for them, they know we all care and they aren't alone anymore."

/*What do I do if I see a homeless person___*/

/**//*unconscious?*/

/**/If the person seems to need medical attention, call 911 immediately.
Make clear that this is a medical not a police emergency.

/*suffering?*/

/**/If you feel safe doing so, you can introduce yourself and ask if the
person is OK and needs a place to stay. You can call 311 and ask for the
Homeless Outreach Team to come talk to the person and offer services and
instructions on how to secure shelter. Or hand them a card with the
toll-free hotline number for Project Homeless Connect (855-588-7968).

/*inebriated?*/

/**/You can call 311 and ask for the Homeless Outreach Team if you see
someone doing something inappropriate or harmful. If you're concerned for your safety or for the
safety of someone experiencing homelessness, call 911. 

/*experiencing a psychotic episode?*/

If the person is in an immediate psychiatric crisis, check in with them
before calling the city's
Mobile Crisis hotline <http://namisf.org/learn-more/crisis-information/>
at (415) 970-4000.

/*with a knife?*/

If you feel threatened by someone who is homeless, call 911 immediately.

But keep in mind, the decision of whether to call 911 to report a
homeless person, should be the same thought process that you would use
to report any threatening behavior from any person, regardless of their
living situation. 

"The San Francisco Police Department spent $20.7 million a year
responding to people's complaints to little effect, according to the
Budget Legislate Office's latest report," Executive Director of the
Coalition on Homelessness <http://www.cohsf.org/>Jennifer Friedenbach
said. "If someone is assaultive or breaking the law, call 911. If
someone isn't threatening, there are other, better places to call."

/*defecating?*/

/**/San Francisco lacks a sufficient number of public restrooms and the
best thing you can do is to contact elected officials and urge them to support building more.

A good place to start is with San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and you can
send him a message through his website sfmayor.org
<http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=7>, email
mayoredwinlee@sfgov.org or call (415) 554-6141. You can also reach out
to your supervisor <http://www.sfbos.org/>.

If your neighborhood specifically lacks public restrooms, contact the
Department of Public Works
<http://www.sfpublicworks.org/about/contact-us> and alert them of the
need for "Pit Stops." 

"Until we have more safe places for people to do their humanly body
functions, they will have to use the streets," Zordel says. "We can help
by providing more safe places to do these private behaviors in a
sanitary way."

/*What should I do if I see a homeless parent and child who seem to need
help?*/

Parents with children should never sleep on the street. You can ask if
they need help and refer them to the Compass Connecting Point for
Families <http://www.sfhsa.org/81.htm> crisis toll-free hotline at (855)
234-2667 for immediate referrals to services and more permanent housing.
If they need immediate housing that night, you can advise them to call
the Hamilton Family Emergency Center
<https://hamiltonfamilycenter.org/>at (415) 292-5228 at 11 a.m. sharp.

You can also call 311 and ask for the Homeless Outreach Team to come
talk to the family and offer services and help in securing shelter.

/*What can I do if a homeless person is sleeping in front of my home or
business?*/ 

You can call 311 and ask for the Homeless Outreach Team to come talk to
the person and offer services.

Or hand them a card with the toll-free hotline number for Project
Homeless Connect (855-588-7968) and a list
<http://www.freeprintshop.org/download/shelter_english.pdf> of the four
reservation centers where they can enroll in the city's shelter program. 

"When you see someone suffering, say something," Zordel says. "I have
businesses call me who are family-owned and they've lost customers due
to people not wanting to walk over those experiencing homelessness
outside their door. That's not OK."

What's more, Zordel says, "It's not safe for people to sleep outside.
They risk being hurt — not to mention that many who experience
homelessness have shorter lives. One U.K. study states most people who
experience long-term homelessness die by 45."

She adds: "There is a difference between discrimination and hate towards
those experiencing homelessness and calling for service that can help
our brothers and sisters get back to a healthy and stable life."

/*I’m homeless, where can I get food? */

To learn about the many food programs throughout the city, you can call
Project Homeless Connect at (855) 588-7968 or visit
projecthomelessconnect.org
<https://www.projecthomelessconnect.org/get-help/service-provider-directory/> for
a list of places throughout the city serving free and low-cost meals.

/*I’m homeless. How can I get a bed for the night? */

You need to be enrolled in the city's Changes program to use shelters
and you can only do this at one of the city's four reservation centers
<http://www.freeprintshop.org/download/shelter_english.pdf> below. Once
enrolled, you can visit these sites for first-come, first-serve beds
available for one night only. One night beds begin to be available at
4:30 p.m. so arrive in the afternoon to secure a spot as they fill up
quickly. 

 1. Mission Neighborhood, 165 Capp (between 16th and 17th streets),
    (415) 869-7977
 2. Bayview Hunters Point, 2111 Jennings (at Van Dyke), (415) 671-1100 
 3. Glide Walk-In Center, 330 Ellis St. (at Taylor), Suite 101, (415)
    674-6012
 4. MSC South, 525 5th St. (at Bryant), (415) 597-7960

If you're enrolled with Changes, you can call 311 to be put on a shelter
waitlist for a 90-day reservation. You can find out your status on the
waitlist by calling 311, visiting one of the four centers or looking
online at sf311.org/waitlist
<http://sf311.org/shelter-reservation-waitlist>. 

If you need more information about how the system works, ask at one of
the four reservation sites.
