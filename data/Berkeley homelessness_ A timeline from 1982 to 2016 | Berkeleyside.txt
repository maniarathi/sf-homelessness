Many people trace the roots of the current homeless crisis back to the
presidency of Ronald Reagan. He came into office in 1981 with a mandate
to cut federal spending. And cut he did. Early in his term Reagan halved
the budget for public housing and even tried to eliminate federal
subsidies for public low-income housing. The annual budget of $16
billion in 1979 went to just $1 billion in 1983. Reagan also did a
number of other things that contributed to a spike in poverty. There was
also a recession. By the mid-1980s, there were about 600,000 homeless
people in the United States. Today there are from 634,000 to 1.6 million
homeless in the U.S., according to various studies. In Berkeley,
official estimates
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-01-26-Item-21-Berkeley-2015-Homeless.pdf>
say were 834 homeless people as of January 2015, while advocates say
there are likely more than 1,000.


      *Partial Berkeley Homelessness Timeline*

*1982* – People in campers set up a “Reaganville” encampment near the
Marina.

*January 1985 –* Rainbow Village opens near the Marina (now Cesar Chavez
Park). It was a half-acre plot for homeless people who lived in vehicles
to park their cars for $30 a month. The city provided some rudimentary
services such as a sink and running water. About 35 to 40 people lived
at Rainbow Village.

*See full coverage on Berkeleyside of the **Berkeley Homeless Project*
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/berkeley-homeless-project/>*.*

*Aug. 16, 1985* – Two “Deadheads” living at Rainbow Village were shot
and killed. The bodies of Mary Regina Gioia, 22, of Schenectady, New
York, and Gregory Kniffin
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=crime&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Gregory+Kniffin%22>,
18, of Wilson, Connecticut, were found in the bay. They had been beaten
badly and shot at close range in the neck. Within a few days, Berkeley
police had arrested Ralph International Thomas, another occupant of
Rainbow Village, and he was eventually charged with the murders. He was
convicted of the killings and sentenced to death. New attorneys later
argued in court that Thomas’ defense attorney had not sought witnesses
that could have helped his case and a federal appeals court eventually
ordered a new trial decades later. Thomas, 59, died in jail in January
2014 while waiting for a new trial.

*March 2, 1986* – Rainbow Village is shut down. The experiment lasted 13
months.

A voucher used in the “Berkeley Cares” program of 1991

*1991* – Berkeley creates a voucher system
<http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-07/news/mn-1306_1_voucher-program>,
“Berkeley Cares,” to assist its homeless population of about 800.
Merchants sold 25-cent vouchers in books of four. The vouchers could be
handed out to homeless people to redeem for laundry, food, showers or
bus service. The downtown merchant group spearheading the program sold
at least $1,900 in vouchers.

*1994* – Berkeley residents pass Measure O to ban lying on sidewalks.
The ACLU filed suit, but the measure was repealed when a new City
Council was elected.

*January 2003* – A count of the Berkeley homeless population
<http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/City_Manager/Press_Releases/2009/2009-07-08_Number_of_Chronically_Homeless_in_Berkeley_Decreases_by_Half.aspx>
indicates there are 821 homeless, with 529 of those “chronically
homeless.” Berkeley has 41% of the county’s homeless population.

*Nov. 27, 2007 *–* *Council adopts a measure put forth by Mayor Tom
Bates called the “Public Commons for Everyone Initiative.”
<http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/City_Manager/Home/Public_Commons_for_Everyone_Initiative.aspx>
It prohibits lying (but not sitting) on the sidewalk and banned smoking
in certain commercial areas. The measure raised parking fees by 25 cents
an hour to improve supportive services for the homeless as well. The
initiative included a “centralized homeless intake system.”

*January 2009* – A count of Berkeley’s homeless population
<http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/City_Manager/Press_Releases/2009/2009-07-08_Number_of_Chronically_Homeless_in_Berkeley_Decreases_by_Half.aspx>
shows there are 680 homeless, a 48% decrease from 2003.

*January 2012* – The newly formed Downtown Berkeley Association, armed
with $1.2 million raised through Business Improvement District fees,
hires 10 Downtown Ambassadors
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/downtown-berkeley-ambassadors/> to keep
the area clean and interact with its homeless population.

*June 12, 2012* – Council votes to put a measure on the November 2012
ballot to ban sitting on sidewalks
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/2012-measure-s/> between 7 a.m. and 10
p.m. Business groups that have been complaining that the sight of so
many homeless people in front of their stores drives customers away
heavily back the measure. The measure provokes a huge split in Berkeley.
There are numerous rallies against the plan.

*Nov. 6, 2012* – Measure S fails
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2012/11/06/berkeleys-election-night-live-blogging/>.

*March and April 2014* – The city of Albany pays about two dozen
homeless people who have been living at the Albany Bulb landfill to
leave town. They each receive $3,000. Many of them move to Berkeley.

*April 10, 2014* – Caltrans installs fencing around state-owned land
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2014/04/10/caltrans-fence-forces-homeless-to-find-new-places-to-sleep/>
under the Gilman Street overpass, pushing those living there onto the
sidewalks and the frontage road nearby, which is owned by the city of
Berkeley.

*July 18, 2014* – The homeless from Albany and Berkeley cluster by the
Gilman underpass again. The city of Berkeley and Caltrans clean up the
area
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2014/07/18/rodents-trash-prompt-city-of-berkeley-clean-up-of-homeless-camp-on-gilman-residents-scattered/>.
The homeless move to the railroad tracks nearby
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2014/07/30/homeless-relocate-to-railroad-tracks-after-gilman-clean-up/>.

*June 19, 2014* – The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules that a Los
Angeles rule prohibiting people from sleeping in their cars is
unconstitutionally vague. The Berkeley city attorney subsequently
determines that the city cannot ticket people for sleeping in cars and
tells police to stop coming down on them. BPD stops ticketing. Soon cars
used as homes are parked along many streets in West Berkeley.

*August 2014* – City Councilman Jesse Arreguín launches the Berkeley
Task Force on Homelessness
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/08/14/new-talks-on-homelessness-in-berkeley-start-thursday/> to
take a comprehensive look at services offered.

*November 2014* – Two groups, First They Came for the Homeless
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/first-they-came-for-the-homeless/> and
Berkeley Post Office Defenders
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/berkeley-post-office-defenders/>, set
up a camp outside the main Berkeley post office at 2000 Allston Way
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/berkeley-post-office/>. Although they
initially set up a protest camp to stop the sale of the historic
building, the site soon drew a number of homeless people who connected
the proposed sale of federal property with a lack of affordable housing
and a rise in homelessness.

*Jan. 28, 2015* – Alameda County conducts a “point in time” count of the
homeless
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-01-26-Item-21-Berkeley-2015-Homeless.pdf>.
Berkeley has an estimated 834 homeless people, with 266 of them in
shelter and 568 living outside. That latter number is 53% higher than
the last count in 2009 <http://everyonehome.org/everyone-counts/>.
(Advocates told Berkeleyside this week they believe the overall tally is
at least 25% too low.)

are now 16.

*March 26, 2015* – A video of a Downtown Ambassador beating a homeless
man becomes public.
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/03/26/video-downtown-berkeley-worker-assaults-homeless-man/>
The next day a group of people hold a rally to protest what they call
ongoing harassment of those living on the streets. The Ambassador
involved is fired.

*May 2015* – Berkeley installs 10 donation boxes
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/05/08/berkeley-launches-donation-boxes-for-homeless-people/> throughout
the downtown. Residents are encouraged to donate money for homeless
services.

homeless. Photo: David Yee ©2015

City outside Old City Hall in November 2015. Photo: David Yee

*November 2015* – In protest of laws suggested by some city of Berkeley
officials
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/12/02/berkeley-council-enacts-street-behavior-regulations/>,
a group of homeless people set up tents on the lawn in front of Old City
Hall. They name their encampment “Liberty City
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/liberty-city/>,” and say they will
police it themselves.

*November-December 2015* – Council votes to enact another set of laws to
address the behavior of those living on the streets
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/12/02/berkeley-council-enacts-street-behavior-regulations/>.
The ordinance restricts the amount of space people sitting on the
sidewalk can use and orders the creation of a facility with lockers for
them to store their stuff. The new laws also ban urinating and
defecating in public and lying in planters or on their rims. People with
shopping carts will only be allowed to leave them in one place for an
hour at a time from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (The laws won’t go into effect
until the lockers can be provided.)

*Dec. 4, 2015* – Liberty City
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/liberty-city/> residents pack up under
orders by the city and under the watchful eye of police.A few of the
residents, including Zint, are arrested.

*Jan. 5, 2016* – Berkeley’s new streamlined service center
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2014/10/01/streamlined-housing-crisis-center-slated-for-berkeley/>
to help the homeless opens at The Hub, at 1901 Fairview St., under the
auspices of Berkeley Food & Housing Project. It is a major step toward a
“housing first” policy that many experts believe is a more effective way
to attempt to end homelessness.

*February 2016 *– Council hears a report from the Homeless Task Force
that includes suggestions for how to help address the issue
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/02/11/op-ed-berkeley-latest-homelessness-recommendations-are-a-lackluster-response-to-a-true-emergency/>.

*April 12, 2016* – U.S. Postal Office inspectors clear the “Post Office
Defenders” encampment
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/04/12/berkeley-post-office-protesters-cleared-out-in-early-morning-raid/>
at the main post office on Allston Way. It had been there for 17 months.
Post office officials immediately erected a metal fence around the area
with a “Do Not Trespass” sign. In June, officials tore out the community
garden that had been erected by the homeless encampment.

*June 16, 2016*  – Caltrans and Berkeley city workers clean up the
encampment under the Gilman underpass
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/gilman-underpass/>, though local
residents are quick to point out that campers continue to live in the area.
