  Unified front in search for answers

June 26, 2016

To the city and people of San Francisco:

Like you, we are frustrated, confused and dismayed by the seemingly
intractable problem of homelessness in our city. Like you, we want
answers — and change.

We see the misery around us — the 6,600 or more people who live on the
streets of San Francisco — and we sense it is worsening. We feel for the
people who live in doorways and under freeways, and for the countless
others who teeter on the edge of eviction. We empathize with the EMTs,
the nurses and doctors, the social workers and the police. They are on
the front lines of this ongoing human catastrophe.

Numerous noble, well-intentioned efforts by both public and private
entities have surfaced over the decades, yet the problem persists. It is
a situation that would disgrace the government of any city. But in the
technological and progressive capital of the nation, it is unconscionable.

So beginning today, more than 70 media organizations are taking the
unprecedented step of working together to focus attention on this
crucial issue.

We will pool our resources — reporting, data analysis, photojournalism,
video, websites — and starting June 29, will publish, broadcast and
share a series of stories across all of our outlets. We intend to
explore possible solutions, their costs and viability.

Though this is a united effort, we do not claim to speak with one voice.
There are many lenses through which the issue of homelessness can be
viewed. However, we do not intend to let a desire for the perfect
solution become the enemy of the good. We want to inspire and incite
each other as much as we want to prod city and civic leaders.

Fundamentally, we are driven by the desire to stop calling what we see
on our streets the new normal. Frustration and resignation are not a
healthy psyche for a city.

Our aim is to provide you with the necessary information and potential
options to put San Francisco on a better path. Then it will be up to all
of us — citizens, activists, public and private agencies, politicians —
to work together to get there.

Signed,

The SF Homeless Project
