  Young and Homeless


    We spent time with four different communities and asked them about
    their experiences. Here’s what we learned.

*In boomtown San Francisco*, there’s little slack for kids still finding
their way. Housing is crunched. Rents top New York’s. Today, roughly one
in five homeless people is 25 or younger. The boom has even hit people
/helping/ these youth; in 2013, after 12 years of running a drop-in
center in the Haight district, the Homeless Youth Alliance lost its
lease (the space where it operated is now listed as renting for $9,000 a
month). The nonprofit became homeless itself, resorting to offering
roving services on the street.

The young and homeless are an especially vulnerable group. They’re more
likely to be LGBTQ and more likely to sleep on the street than the
general homeless population. In the 2015 Homeless Youth Count and
Survey, 27 percent reported they had traded drugs and 20 percent had
traded sex for a place to stay. Forty-three percent said they’d been
assaulted.

The White House has set an ambitious goal to end youth and family
homelessness by 2020. Here in San Francisco, lawmakers have committed
new city funding. They are also in the process of working out
legislation to open six “navigation centers” over the next two years. A
pilot center, in the Mission, guides people into housing without the
rigid rules that lead many people to avoid traditional shelters (no
pets, no drinking, no partners). One of the new centers will likely be
earmarked for youth, in the hopes of getting young people quickly off
the streets.

We spent time with four different communities of homeless youth and
asked them about their experiences. We also looked at some of the
different ways people are trying to help. We heard a lot of tough
stories, but also reasons for hope: For most young people, homelessness
is not yet a chronic condition. Many describe it as a stop on the road
to something else.
