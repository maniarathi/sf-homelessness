  *THE END OF FAMILY HOMELESSNESS BEGINS WITH BABIES (& ENDS WITH HOUSING)*


        /An open letter from Martha Ryan, Homeless Prenatal Program
        Founder & Executive Director/

Thank you all for rallying together in response to San Francisco’s
housing crisis through yesterday’s San Francisco Homeless Project. The
Homeless Prenatal Program <http://www.homelessprenatal.org/> was
delighted to engage with and reflect on so many important aspects of
this complex problem. While I appreciated so much coverage dedicated to
homelessness, I was disappointed to see that homeless families — who
represent ~30% of the homeless population — were not given much attention.

When I began HPP in 1989, homeless families were the fastest growing
subset of the homeless population. Sadly, not much has changed in the
past 27 years. In fact, it’s gotten far worse. Throughout the years,
decreases in government aid to struggling families have resulted in
staggering increases in homelessness. More and more families come to HPP
every year — families who have no place to go, families fleeing intimate
partner violence, families experiencing such poverty that they are on
the edge of homelessness.

We have rigged systems in place that undermine the underserved: health
disparities that lead to limited access to care, a broken education
system that creates a school to prison pipeline and levels of economic
inequity — especially in the Bay Area — that are shameful. There is no
doubt that a baby born to parents from residents of the tent city
mentioned in the New York Times article
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/us/san-francisco-homelessness.html?_r=0>
will have a different life path than a baby born to more significant means.

HPP works with over 4,000 families annually, about 25% of which are
pregnant and over 50% of which are homeless. Some of our families live
in the aforementioned tent city. Many more — most — are invisible. They
are not as recognizable, nor counted in homeless surveys. They are often
out of view, living in cars or tripled up with families and
acquaintances, living in studio apartments. But they are struggling.

How do we end homelessness in our community?


      The Homeless Prenatal Program believes in a two-generational
      approach that prevents homelessness before it starts.

We believe in housing and services that enable all children have healthy
starts; that support parents in their pathways to stability and that
provide job opportunities with education and training. Truly, the
structures in place creating such inequity and disparity need to be
disassembled and reassembled in a way that benefits all. In the
meantime, HPP seeks to support parents steadfast in our belief that our
interventions are decreasing the likelihood of their children also
ending up homeless.

We also believe in housing with ongoing services. 96% of our families
placed in housing are stably housed one year later. The biggest problem
is that the rents are so high in San Francisco and the larger Bay Area
that it’s difficult to find housing, even with support.


      If we are serious about this problem, we need to demand adequate
      housing for all.

We need affordable housing and more money to help families rebound. As
agencies, we need to partner to ensure our services are as robust and
efficient as possible. As citizens, we need to write our elected
officials and vote on the ballot measures
<https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/05/27/sf-arts-and-homeless-organizations-join-forces-to-secure-more-city-funding/>
coming up in the election this fall. We need to volunteer and donate to
agencies that are making a difference. And most importantly, we need to
continue the conversation past June 29th to keep learning and listening
about how we can help those in need.

Thanks to everyone who participated in *#sfhomelessproject* and to all
those who work for social justice daily.

Sincerely,

Martha Ryan, Homeless Prenatal Program Founder & Executive Director
