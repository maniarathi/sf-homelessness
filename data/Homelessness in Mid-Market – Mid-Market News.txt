    Ministering to the Forgotten

| By Kyle Ludowitz |

Sauntering down the streets of the Tenderloin at 2 a.m. wearing a
clerical collar, Rev. Lyle Beckman doesn’t want to give the impression
of haste. He is right here he needs to be. He walks the city streets
every night from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. offering crisis intervention,
counseling, and pastoral care to the homeless.

The San Francisco Night Ministry is a team of multi-denominational
street ministers who engage in conversations from benign to divine.
Carrying extra socks, sweatshirts, hats and tampons for those who need
them, street ministers connect with the most vulnerable class of
citizens that are so often overlooked and struggle to contend with a
life of survival on the streets.
