For more than three decades, homelessness has consistently been one of
San Francisco’s most troubling, intractable problems.

It’s also been a political lightning rod in a city known both for its
liberal views and significant income gap. Every mayor since Dianne
Feinstein has promised to attack the issue,  some putting their money on
support services others on aggressive law enforcement strategies.
They’ve all fallen far short of their goals.

There have been some successes, even though progress is often difficult
to notice. Over the past decade, the city has gotten more than 20,000
people off its streets. But the day-to-day population hasn’t budged —
it’s actually risen slightly, to almost 6,700, according to a 2015 count
<http://sfgov.org/lhcb/2015-san-francisco-point-time-homeless-count-0> —
even as the city now spends nearly a quarter-billion dollars a year on
homeless services. The following timeline describes the different ways
each of the the city’s last six mayors tried to tackle the issue. Photos
