Go to a corner store and try to stock a bathroom with toiletries all at
once. Add camping gear and an emergency kit.

It could cost you quite a bit.

Homeless and low-income folks often don’t have the money to spend on
these items, and usually must limit how much space their items take up.
Belongings are often stolen, lost or damaged by day-to-day life on the
street, or confiscated by Public Works crews when encampments are swept
away.

Enter the Tenderloin’s GLIDE Memorial Church’s GLIDE Goods program, a
pop-up store that launched in May to distribute these goods, most as
sample sizes, free of charge.

Staff and volunteers in GLIDE’s walk-in center used to pass out hygiene
kits, but had too many other things to focus on like case management and
human services.

In GLIDE’s Freedom Hall at 330 Ellis St., above the basement-level
kitchen where the organization serves more than 2,100 meals a day, the
new pop-up shop allows one staff member and two volunteers to spend time
with each customer, describing the offerings and getting personal with
the regulars.

“We’ve had people come in who have a job interview or have to get a job
the next day. It just gets them through when their funds run out at the
end of the month,” GLIDE’s clinical director Kenneth Kim said.

Cindy McGovern started volunteering at GLIDE when the pop-up first
started. She is there each Monday night and Tuesday morning, learning
the customer’s names and trying to make them laugh and feel welcome, she
said.

Not many people know about the pop-up yet, but those who visit are of
many backgrounds and ages. “It’s from 16 to 65,” she said. “Most of the
people are waiting for a bed.”

Anyone can line up at the GLIDE Goods counter to choose items from a
picture book called the shop’s “item quilt.”

The most popular items are socks, soap, shampoo and toothbrushes. The
pop-up also stocks sunscreen, tampons, condoms, deodorant, first aid
kits, combs, hair picks and emergency blankets, among other items.

“Everybody who’s homeless needs clean socks,” she said. McGovern now
lives in an SRO nearby but was homeless for years, living in a field in
Fresno before moving to San Francisco to enroll in the Harbor Light
detox program.

The pop-up doesn’t get very busy because it’s still so new, so McGovern
sometimes walks outside “to go get someone.” She invites the people
inside where the volunteers record their information for GLIDE
demographics and give them the hygiene supplies they need.

“I wish I had a line around the corner,” McGovern said.

The new GLIDE Goods pop-up is open Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. during the
Syringe Access program, which is open 7 to 9 p.m. It’s also open on
Tuesdays from 9 to 11 a.m. and Wednesdays 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. Starting in
July, the pop-up will be open on Fridays from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.

“We don’t give out used items, only new donations,” Kim said. GLIDE
raised the money through a fundraising campaign on Roonga, a
crowdfunding platform for nonprofits needing to purchase specific
supplies. “It’s not helpful when people come by and drop off things. …
It can put us in a bind as we figure out space.”

Through monetary donations, GLIDE is able to maintain consistent
offerings like a corner store would. The pop-up emphasizes giving choice
to the customers.

“These little items create an opportunity for conversation,” Kim said,
like when one customer needed lotion for his painfully dry feet and was
referred to GLIDE’s health clinic upstairs.

Despite GLIDE’s origins as a church organization, its pop-up and other
programs do not involve preaching or exclude anyone based on religion.

“Being inclusive and radically inclusive, people come in whatever shape
or form they come in. There’s no religious affiliation with any of our
services. Depending on how a person wants to pursue their recovery, they
have options,” Kim said.
