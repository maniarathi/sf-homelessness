The city's second Navigation Center for the homeless 
<http://hoodline.com/2016/04/details-on-market-street-s-new-navigation-center-set-to-open-in-june?utm_source=story&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=stories>has
officially opened at 12th and Market.

In March, Mayor Ed Lee announced plans 
<http://hoodline.com/2016/03/mayor-lee-to-announce-navigation-center-civic-center-hotel?utm_source=story&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=stories&utm_source=story&utm_medium=web>to
replicate the success of the first Navigation Center in the Mission by
working with Tenderloin-based nonprofit Community Housing
Partnership to renovate the Civic Center Hotel at 20 12th St.

At the time, the single-room occupancy hotel—well-known for its squalid
condition and incidences of crime both in and around the building—was
already home to 53 low-income residents, and slated for
a major redevelopment
<http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Hotel-site-going-from-squalor-to-hot-development-6274343.php> in
the next two to three years. Now, 93 of the hotel's vacant rooms will be
used to temporarily house and help homeless residents who move on to
permanent housing. 

Yesterday's grand opening celebration for "Navigation Center 2" came
just two weeks after the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously
<http://www.sfexaminer.com/clock-ticking-sf-create-six-navigation-centers-within-two-years/>
to open a total of six new Navigation Centers over the next two years.

The /Chronicle/ reported 
<http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-opens-new-full-service-shelter-to-get-homeless-8330473.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter>that
55 individuals have already moved into the Civic Center Hotel over the
past few months, leaving roughly 40 rooms left to fill. Some of those
rooms will be reserved for case managers and counselors, who will help
residents stabilize their lives.

According to a press release
<http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=846&recordid=1209&returnURL=%2findex.aspx> from
the mayor's office, the original Navigation Center at 1950 Mission St.,
run by Episcopal Community Services
<http://www.ecs-sf.org/programs/navcenter.html>, has served 550 clients
in a little over a year. Of those individuals, 80 percent have either
moved into "stable supportive housing" or been reunited with friends and
family.

Jeff Kositsky
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Jeff+Kositsky%22>, head
of the new Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, also
announced a new initiative: the Encampment Response Team. They'll be
responsible for tracking encampments, conducting outreach and placing
people in shelters, and communicating with neighbors, in cooperation
with the Mayor’s new Fix-It Team
<http://hoodline.com/2016/06/city-s-new-fix-it-team-seeks-input-to-address-castro-s-quality-of-life-issues?utm_source=story&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=stories&utm_source=story&utm_medium=web>,
the Homeless Outreach Team, Public Works, Public Health, SFPD, SFFD and
Rec and Park.

“The new Encampment Response Team will ensure that our residents living
in encampments receive the shelter and services they deserve, and that
our neighborhoods remain safe and healthy for families and everyone. The
department is deeply committed to this initiative, and to addressing
encampments in San Francisco,” Kositsky said in the release. 

Despite the new shelter and the new outreach team, finding permanent
housing for the homeless is still one of the city's top
priorities, Kositsky told /Chron/.

The city is requiring six new Navigation Centers to open by mid-2018—one
of which must be aimed at youth. But no one's taking action.
