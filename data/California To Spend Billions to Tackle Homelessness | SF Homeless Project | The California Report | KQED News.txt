California has more than 115,000 homeless people
<https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2015-AHAR-Part-1.pdf>,
many suffering from some kind of mental illness. This week the state
Legislature is acting on a $2 billion bond
<http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1618> that
would help get many of them off the streets. The state Senate approved
the bond yesterday, the Assembly is expected to take it up later this week.

People like Angelina Washington. She is homeless and currently lives in
a long-term shelter for women with mental illnesses at Sacramento’s
Loaves & Fishes <http://www.sacloaves.org/>. That’s a nonprofit that
provides services to the homeless. Washington has a simple wish, if she
ever has her own apartment.

“To sleep in when I want,” she says. “We can’t sleep in over there at
the shelter. We have to get up at 6:30 and we have to be out by 8.”

Because she’s been homeless for so long and suffers from mental illness,
Washington could potentially benefit from the proposed bond. It would
make $2 billion available to California counties over several years to
create permanent supportive housing for people like her. The bond would
be paid for with funds from Proposition 63 <http://prop63.org/>, which
provides money for mental health services.

Joan Burke is director of advocacy at Loaves & Fishes. She says the
money would help expand programs that have already proved successful.

“We do know what works. And we do have good programs that are helping
people get out of homelessness much more quickly,” she says. “We just
don’t have enough of them.”

sfproject3 <http://ww2.kqed.org/news/series/sf-homeless-project>

Senate President pro tempore Kevin de León started thinking about the
bill last fall after taking a tour of Skid Row in Los Angeles. Counties
already provide various services to the homeless. But de León says
having a home is key to helping a person get stable.

“You just cannot provide psychotherapeutic services or substance abuse
therapeutic services and expect them to go back and live in a cardboard
box in an alley or adjacent to an off-ramp,” he says. “It’s nonsensical.
It’s illogical. And you’re wasting money.”

Jennifer Wolch is dean of UC Berkeley’s College of Environmental Design
and studies homelessness. She says housing-first approaches have been
extremely successful. She acknowledges the strategy is initially
expensive, but says it’s a good investment.

“Ultimately it costs taxpayers more money to leave people on the
streets,” she says.

Wolch does foresee some challenges, specifically where the housing will
be built. She says neighborhoods tend to push back when low-income
housing or other services are proposed nearby.

“There’s a lot of resistance that needs to be dealt with,” she says.
“And I think that some of it has to be legislated in terms of not
allowing communities to zone out or, in various other ways, exclude
these kinds of facilities.”

Money from the bond could be awarded as early as this fiscal year, which
begins in July.

California voters have supported large housing bonds in the
past, including a $2.1 billion bond in 2002
<https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_46,_Bonds_for_Housing_Projects_(2002)> and
a $2.9 billion bond in 2006
<https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_1C,_Bonds_for_Housing_(2006)> for
overall housing programs. In 2014, voters approved $600 million for
veterans’ housing
<https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_41,_Veterans_Housing_and_Homeless_Prevention_Bond_(2014)>.
