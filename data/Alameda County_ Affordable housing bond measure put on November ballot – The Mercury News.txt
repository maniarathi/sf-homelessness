OAKLAND — Alameda County voters in November will vote on an affordable
housing measure that county leaders say will help poor families,
first-time homebuyers, the homeless and veterans.

The county board of supervisors voted 5-0 on Tuesday to place the $580
million bond measure on the fall ballot.

“The affordable housing bond will provide $580 million in investment in
affordable homes for low-income renters, down payment assistance for
first time homebuyers and an innovation fund to seek new solutions,”
Supervisor Wilma Chan said.

As rents and home values skyrocketed over the past five years, the
county has seen longtime residents move away and an increase in
homelessness, according to a presentation at Tuesday’s meeting.

Countywide, rents have increased 34 percent between 2011 and 2015, with
the median rent for a residence reaching $2,724 last year, according to
county figures. At the same time, home values have soared to an average
of $711,000 for single family homes.

Proponents of the measure say there is a shortfall of 60,911 units that
very low to low income people can afford.
