For years, Lester Harris has been shining shoes at his stand just steps
from San Francisco’s Market and Powell streets. But unlike his fellow
working folk who head home after a long day on the job, Harris has no
home to return to. Joe Rosato reports. (Published Wednesday, June 29, 2016)

Lester Harris is a man of redemption - a healer of sorts. Day after day
at his Union Square shoeshine stand, he applies his restorative powers
to loafers, dress shoes and boots — transforming them from faded,
weathered shoes into gleaming vessels.

"When I put a shine on that shoe," Harris boasted, "you will scratch
your head and say that sure was a beautiful shine."

For years, Harris has been shining shoes at his stand just steps from
San Francisco's Market and Powell Streets, where tourists line-up to
ride the cable cars. His clientele include business people, tourists and
droves of shoppers.

But unlike his fellow working folk who head home after a long day on the
job, Harris has no home to return to. 

"I've been on the streets about 25 years altogether total," Harris
revealed, his voice animated like a firery preacher's. "I stay wherever
I can stay. I'm staying from one doorstep to the next."

streets after a day's work.

Harris has slept beneath bridges and in doorways. He has braved the cold
San Francisco nights, taking shelter on hard concrete and in bushes.
Unable to afford an apartment, he sometimes sleeps on a rotating network
of friends' couches. 

"You know what keeps me going?" Harris asked. "Coming to work, getting
up every day and doing something - working, shining these shoes. That's
what keeps me going and what keeps my spirits up."

Harris counts himself among San Francisco's working poor — workers whose
salaries won't come close to denting the rent of an apartment in the
city's skyrocketing economy. A native San Franciscan, Harris lives in
the city of his birth — inside its 49 square miles, yet just outside its
embrace.

"I'm a hard working person," Harris said. "I work hard every day. But I
don't have a place to live and that's not fair."

Every day, fellow homeless friends come by Harris' shoeshine stand to
jaw about the state of the city. They commiserate about waiting lists
for housing, the wretched conditions of some Tenderloin's SRO hotels and
the swelling number of homeless on the street.

Street.

"We never had homelessness like this, it's getting really bad," one
friend noted. 

"If each one of those billionaires donated a million dollars," another
said, "that might help some of the homeless."

Harris nodded; "it's time to get off these streets and get in to a place
of our own, that we can call our own place."

According to a recent national survey, a person would need to earn
$216,000 a year to comfortably afford a two-bedroom apartment in San
Francisco. That's a lot of shoes. 

"You gotta be like Curry to make the rent" Harris said with a boisterous
laugh that quickly morphed into contemplation. He shook his head,
causing his braids to swing like a set of tassels on a pair of loafers. 

Harris tried driving a cab. But he preferred shining shoes because he
liked meeting people. With this crisp suit and easy laugh, few customers
picked-up on the true story of his meager existence in the City by the Bay.

"I never thought that I would be here and homeless," Harris said guiding
a new customer into the chair and taking-up his shoe brush. "Never
thought I'd be homeless in this city."
