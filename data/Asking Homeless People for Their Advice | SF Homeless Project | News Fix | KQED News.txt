As part of KQED’s coverage of homelessness this week, Pulitzer-Prize
winning cartoonist Mark Fiore interviewed a number of homeless people in
San Francisco and produced a series of five cartoons based on what they
told him.

“With these cartoons, I want to give people who are living on the
streets a chance to be heard, said Fiore. “It’s vitally important to
discuss solutions to the homelessness crisis. I think it’s also valuable
to understand what homeless people are going through every day. ”

“I asked people who have been homeless or are going through it
currently, ‘What advice would you give someone who was newly-homeless?'”

These conversations took place on sidewalks, street corners and benches
from Union Square to South of Market.
