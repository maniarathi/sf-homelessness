1.

Walking down Turk Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood, Sam
Dodge is optimistic. The number of homeless encampments is down, thanks
in part to efforts by the city, and in part to construction that has
pushed them elsewhere.

Dodge greets a few of the people sitting on the wide sidewalk, some with
goods for sale in front of them, and asks if there is anything they
need. He walked from his office at City Hall to check on reports of
encampments.

Many refer to Dodge as the homeless czar of San Francisco. As the
director of the mayor's office of HOPE (Housing, Opportunity,
Partnerships and Engagement), his five-person team oversees the mayor's
response to homelessness in the city.

Dodge keeps an eye on the streets, regularly checking in on areas where
the homeless live, so he can be in tune with current needs when he meets
with government officials, community members, and the mayor.

Tilden Porter sits outside a temporary shelter in the Dogpatch
neighborhood of San Francisco. Porter arrived at the shelter when it
opened and will stay until it closes as he waits to get into senior
housing. The shelter allows people to come and go freely once they're
checked in, which has proved valuable to the residents.

4.

In the United States, seventy percent of the country's homeless
population has shelter every night and thirty percent sleep on the
streets. In San Francisco, the opposite is true: seventy percent sleep
on the streets. This means the homeless are a very visible presence in
San Francisco.

Dodge frequently uses the statistic that California has twelve percent
of the nation's population but twenty percent of the nation's homeless
to demonstrate the scale of the homeless issue.

//Sarah Rice / for NBC News
5.

Homeless individuals take shelter at Saint Boniface Church in San
Francisco. The church is open during the day for homeless people to
sleep in its pews through the Gubbio Project.

Rising property values in San Francisco have kept rent prices among the
most expensive in the country, making it especially difficult to find
affordable housing for the homeless. Dodge is not deterred.

"We can end homelessness," he said. "This is a problem that we know the
solutions to."

"I love it here," Terrence Smith said outside a temporary shelter. The
shelter on Pier 80 in the Dogpatch neighborhood has a more relaxed
environment than others in the city.

7.

Historically, San Francisco has operated differently than larger cities,
some of which have departments of homeless services with staffs in the
hundreds. Specific issues in the city are handled separately by their
corresponding departments, with no one department overseeing everything.

The HOPE office attempts to coordinate all of the government offices in
addition to community groups and homeless needs.

//Sarah Rice / for NBC News
8.

"We're in the same boat as most communities, where the need just
overwhelms the resources that we have" Dodge said. "We try to do really
creative and good work, but we end up not making as much progress as we
wish we could."

That structure is about to change. Beginning in July, the city will
start a new chapter by forming its first Department on Homelessness and
Supportive Housing, which will coordinate most services for the homeless
and allow all of those services to work together.

//Sarah Rice / for NBC News
9.

During his walking tours of the city, Dodge regularly embraces homeless
and formerly homeless friends, kneels down to talk, holds their hands,
and listens to their stories.

"These are our family members, these are our neighbors, these are people
that we have a responsibility for and we're leaving them out on the
street to suffer and that's not alright," said Dodge. "That's not
alright with me and it's not alright for a growing majority of people in
America."
