  Would a homeless mayor in Berkeley make a difference for the homeless?

June 29, 2016 1:00 pm by Frances Dinkelspiel

Guy “Mike” Lee <http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/mike-lee/> sat at a
wooden table in the back of Au Coquelet restaurant on University Avenue.
His laptop computer was open in front of him, its cord stretching behind
to an electrical outlet on the wall. Lee’s cell phone was also charging.

This spot serves as an office of sorts for Lee, 60, who is running for
mayor of Berkeley. Lee is homeless, so every morning he travels from
where he sleeps (which he won’t reveal – for safety reasons, he says) to
coffee shops and quick-serve restaurants in the downtown, meeting people
along the way.

“People come looking for me,” said Lee, who has a broad forehead, deep
brown eyes and a long, wiry salt and pepper beard. “They check in
at Starbucks depending what time it is. Generally Monday through Friday
it’s Starbucks or McDonald’s. If they don’t see me, they’ll come down here.”

Lee only arrived in Berkeley on this go-around about a year ago, but in
that short time he has emerged as a voice for the homeless, as well as a
leader. He was part of the “Post Office Defenders,”
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/berkeley-post-office-defenders/> the
group that occupied a space next to the Main Post Office on Allston Way
until it was shut down in April.
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/04/12/berkeley-post-office-protesters-cleared-out-in-early-morning-raid/>
He participated in Liberty City,
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/liberty-city/> the encampment outside
Old City Hall last winter. Lee is active on Facebook and keeps up a
steady stream of posts on his page, The Bum As Mayor?
<https://www.facebook.com/groups/692045224265198/>  He is also in
regular communication with city officials and politicians.

In his previous life, Lee helped run the Buzzard Flats Trading Post in
Las Vegas, which sold goods at swap meets around the region. Poor health
drove him to the Bay Area where Lee assumed he could live on what it
cost him to live in Nevada: about $600 a month. That proved not to be
true. When the $3,000 he brought ran out, Lee found himself living
outside to get by. He gets about $1,000 a month in Social Security
benefits, enough to help him eat and maintain a membership at the YMCA,
where he can shower.

Once Lee became homeless, he was shocked by the paternalism of the
system and its emphasis on handing out sandwiches over more meaningful
help, he said. He believes there is a type of “social service agency
industrial complex” that is inefficient and ineffective and that wants
to hamper homeless self-determination so it can continue to receive
funding from the city of Berkeley. Lee even goes so far as to say that
some of Berkeley’s social service agencies are “crooked,” although he
praises others.

“The basic message is to teach homeless people you have to be helpless,”
said Lee. “We have a system that is broken. It has no priorities. Their
only solutions are criminalization or charity.”

After Lee began speaking out about his perspective, some of his friends
urged him to run for mayor. Many of them were outraged by the current
council majority, which has passed laws (not yet in effect) tightly
regulating how much space homeless people can take up on sidewalks
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/12/02/berkeley-council-enacts-street-behavior-regulations/>.
Lee and other people living on Berkeley’s streets felt there was
a misunderstanding of who the homeless are and that they are capable of
running their affairs.

“We wanted to make sure that certain issues got onto the table of public
discussion,” said Lee. He wanted “to be the voice of the voiceless, to
speak to our higher hopes and aspirations.”

Lee is not the first homeless person to run for mayor in Berkeley, but
he is the most serious. Zachary Running Wolf
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/zachary-running-wolf/>, most famous for
sitting in a tree for two years to stop UC Berkeley from cutting down a
grove of old oaks in order to build a student athletic facility by
Memorial Stadium, ran for mayor in 2012. He has also taken out papers
for this year’s election
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/berkeley-mayoral-hopefuls-weigh-in-on-homelessness/>.

“The significance of a homeless man running for mayor is crazy,” said Lee.

Osha Neumann <http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/osha-neumann/>, a lawyer
who frequently advocates for the homeless, said it is probably a good
thing that Lee’s voice is among those running for mayor, although given
Berkeley’s dismissive attitude he is not sure it will matter much.

“We’ll see if it pushes the conversation,” said Neumann.

Lee announced his candidacy in January. Many of his supporters are
people who have worked with the unhoused population for a long time,
such as boona cheema, <http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/boona-cheema/>
the longtime director of BOSS, <http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/boss/>
or Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency. It is definitely a
barebones, grassroots campaign. In his last filing, Lee did not report
any campaign contributions. He did report he had $100.60 on hand. In
contrast, in January, City Councilman Jesse Arreguín had around $23,000
on hand and City Councilman Laurie Capitelli had around $6,200.

Lee has a website, “Old Bum for Mayor, <http://www.oldbumformayor.org/>”
which is how he refers to himself, as well as a Facebook page. On June
22, Lee was waiting at Au Coquelet for the delivery of hundreds of
postcards he could pass out to voters.

Despite the start-up nature of the campaign, Lee has developed an
extensive platform that addresses crime, housing and, of course,
homelessness. He has set forth a number of solutions he believes could
ease Berkeley’s homelessness by 20% by providing “a hand-up, not a
handout.” Lee wants to convert the vacant West Berkeley Senior Center
into dormitory-style housing <http://www.oldbumformayor.org/elders.html>
for about 100 elderly homeless people. They would pay a portion of their
government assistance toward rent. He wants to create a bunkhouse for
the working poor <http://www.oldbumformayor.org/working.html>, those who
earn such low wages they can’t afford rent. He is also advocating for
the creation of “tiny houses,” that homeless people can live in. The
city of Berkeley, including Capitelli, as well as the Berkeley Rotary
Club are supporting Lee’s idea to build a demonstration house Aug. 6.

Considering Lee’s housing situation, one might expect him to embrace all
of the homeless in Berkeley. He does not. He is particularly critical of
those he calls “tweakers,” or methamphetamine users
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/homelessness-in-berkeley-an-overview/>.
Lee believes they give the rest of the homeless a bad name because they
live in squalor, shoot up in public, and can be violent.

“We will not be associated with tweakers,” said Lee. “If your behavior
calls attention to me and my ability to survive, you have to go away.
[If not] “We would take out our baseball bats and beat their asses, ” he
said.

Toward the end of the occupation of the post office, a number of drug
users moved in, said Lee. The group kept asking Berkeley police to force
them to leave, but police said they could not do that. Police told Lee
they could only intervene if a crime was being committed or there was
probable cause to investigate. Lee believes this cautious attitude
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/homelessness-in-berkeley-the-fact-sheet/>
is one reason the encampment at the Gilman underpass
<http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/gilman-underpass/> keeps growing.

“You want to talk about why people are going back to Gilman Street?”
said Lee. “It’s because the Berkeley Police Department doesn’t enforce
the law.”

occupy city hallLee has called for another occupation of the land in
front of Old City Hall starting July 2 to call attention to what is
happening with homeless people in Berkeley.

Lee has a history of activism. In 1992, he was one of the four people
sued by UC Berkeley for protesting the construction of volleyball courts
in People’s Park. In 1991, the university had started construction of
the courts to transform the park from a place only used by people on the
streets to one where families felt welcome. There was a raft of
protests, and a group that Lee was a member of, the People’s Park
Defense Union, passed out fliers and demonstrated. Cal sued Lee, Carol
Denney, David Nadel, the then-owner of Ashkenaz, and one other person,
“accusing them of vandalizing and sabotaging the school’s construction
of a volleyball court in the park.”
<http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/28/1251.html> UC
Berkeley dropped the suit in 1994 after “winning a permanent injunction
banning the activists from vandalizing school property.”

Lee said he ignores the injunction against him. He believes the land
belongs to the people.

“I do go to People’s Park,” he said. “They think it’s UC property. I beg
to differ.”
