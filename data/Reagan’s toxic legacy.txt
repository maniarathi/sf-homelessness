  Reagan’s toxic legacy


    December 23, 1988: We aren’t responsible

In a now infamous interview a few days before Christmas in 1984, Ronald
Reagan insisted that a significant number of homeless people lived on
the streets by choice. “They make it their own choice for staying out
there,” he told ABC’s David Brinkley. “There are shelters in virtually
every city, and shelters here, and those people still prefer out there
on the grates or the lawn to going into one of those shelters.”
