How Silicon Valley, land of free grub, fights food waste
<javascript:void(0)> // How Silicon Valley, land of free grub, fights
food waste   
Wednesday, 29 Jun 2016 | 7:00 AM ET | 01:37

<javascript:void(0)>

Bay Area tech companies are known for their perks, especially their free
food. That means tons — literally — of uneaten food going wasted every week.

Food waste isn't just Silicon Valley's problem, either. The United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization determined that the world has
870 million hungry people
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/us/food-waste-is-becoming-serious-economic-and-environmental-issue-report-says.html?_r=0>.
They could benefit from wasted food, which amounts to $940 billion
globally every year.

According to a new study
<http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-information-bulletin/eib121.aspx>
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 31 percent, or 133 billion
pounds, of the 430 billion pounds of available food supply in the U.S.
went uneaten in 2010. The estimated value of the food loss was $161.6
billion and equates to 141 trillion calories wasted, or 1,249 calories
wasted per person, per day.

Last year the U.S. government issued a food waste reduction goal,
calling for a 50 percent cut by 2030. "Reducing food losses by just 15
percent would provide enough food for more than 25 million Americans
every year, helping to sharply reduce incidences of food insecurity for
millions," the USDA said

This goal is easier said than done, when Americans waste up to 50
percent more food than U.S. consumers did in the 1970s, according to the
National Institutes of Health. Most humans are prone to dispose of
leftovers without thinking twice, so it's taken years for activists to
bring this issue to the table for discussion.


        Creating solutions that work

San Francisco-based Food Runners is one organization working to reduce
food waste and raise awareness about the problem. The all-volunteer
group partners with hundreds of Bay Area companies, including Google
<http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL>, Twitter
<http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR> and Airbnb, where leftover food is
picked up and delivered to those in need.

"There was a period in the late '90s when there were a whole bunch of
men who didn't care about anyone else," Mary Risley, founder of Food
Runners, said in an interview. "Now we have millennials with start-ups,
and they do care. ... I praise the people who are working hard at their
computers for 12 hours a day."

Food Runners was founded by Risley in 1987, and today volunteers pick up
food from more than 500 businesses throughout San Francisco, with the
donor list growing every week, Risley said. Her team delivers enough
food for more than 5,000 meals a day.

"We are overwhelmed to tell you the truth because there is so much food,
and there is so much need," L'Ann Bingham, community relations
representative at Food Runners, said in an interview. "It has gotten
busier and busier and busier for us, and there's awareness now around
the amount of food that is being wasted."

Corporations such as Panera Bread <http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PNRA>,
Kroger <http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/KR> and Darden Restaurants
<http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DRI> have committed to donating excess food
and raising awareness on the issue, and more organizations similar to
Food Runners — such as Maryland-based Hungry Harvest
<http://www.hungryharvest.net/> and Chicago-based Zero Percent
<https://www.zeropercent.us/> — have followed Risley's lead in
delivering corporate leftovers to those in need.


        Challenges along the way

While it might sound painless for businesses to pare food waste and
donate leftovers, there are many obstacles that pose roadblocks to
progress.

In a 2013 survey
<http://www.foodwastealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FWRA_BSR_Tier2_FINAL.pdf>
conducted by the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, an initiative started by
the food sector's leading trade associations, more than three-quarters
of respondents indicated there are barriers to donating excess food. The
biggest challenges include transportation constraints, liability
concerns and insufficient storage at food banks, the survey found.

Big tech companies and smaller start-ups in San Francisco today have the
unique opportunity to find innovative and cutting-edge ways to fight
food waste, Risley said. This might involve reducing portion sizes,
reconsidering tossing something before an expiration date and changing
one's attitude about food overall.

"At Twitter, we ensure that no food is wasted," Kevin McConvey, general
manager of Bon Appetit at Twitter, said in a statement. "Every day we
work with Food Runners to help those in need, and on our companywide
days of service, Twitter employees assemble thousands of sandwiches for
Food Runners to distribute to neighborhood food programs."

With 795 million undernourished people in the world today, that means 1
in 9 individuals don't get enough food to be considered "healthy,"
according to the U.N.'s World Food Programme. "Wasted food represents a
missed opportunity to improve global food security."

Risley sees Food Runners reducing homelessness, supporting communities
of retirees, assisting child after-care programs and continuing to
partner with more tech companies in San Francisco, she said.

"I believe we are moving from an incredibly wasteful society into a
sharing society, and there is nothing more important than sharing excess
food," Risley said. "I want everyone to know there is no reason to
discard edible food in San Francisco."
