Humanizing homelessness in San Francisco. One story at a time. Soon to
be published in a book.
Jun 29

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  “The city doesn’t see us, and they don’t want to see us. To them,
  we’re just expenses and logistical issues.” Carl

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1956. I came to San Francisco almost
forty years ago now, when I was 23. I was doing well for myself when I
got here. I had to work three jobs, but I managed, and got my own
apartment, even if it wasn’t the best.

He was a slumlord. He would cut the heat, unless there was an
inspection. We went eleven years without heat; we used our stoves to
keep warm on the worst nights. We weren’t, the other tenants and me,
asking for anything special. We just wanted what we paid rent for, and I
paid my rent. We just wanted to be treated like decent human beings, so
we sued, the six of us. And we won.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      “I’m not a bad person, but because I’m on street, I am. Just
      because I’m homeless.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I took in two kids, a boy and a girl, and their mother; she was a friend
of mine. I saw those kids with nowhere to go and I couldn’t let them be
out on the street. Even though she had problems, those babies needed
someone to care about them. When her drug problem got worse, Child
Protective Services came and took the kids away. She blamed me, saying I
called them. I had a nervous breakdown and I had to leave. It wasn’t
because of drugs or alcohol or anything like that, even though that’s
what everyone thinks. I had been living in the same place for nineteen
years when I had to leave. I hear about where they are when I can, she’s
with her grandma and he got adopted. I don’t know if I’ll ever see them
again. Someday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      “I will never lie to you or nobody, ok? Because it’s not worth it.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been homeless for a year and a half. Every day is hard. I’m old
now, I’m 59. My heart’s not great and I have arthritis and emphysema.
Every day is going from one place to the next and it wears on me. We
have to be up and out of the shelters by morning, and then I’m on my own
tracking down services all over the city.

I don’t see why they can’t bring the help to us. I don’t see how they
can’t give us a toilet to use at night. I don’t see why they do half the
things they do. A few things could be so much better for so little, but
the city doesn’t seem to care.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      “Just housing people on an emergency winter shelter basis, and
      giving them two meals, is not going to help them when the
      program’s all over, ok?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every day I’m fighting with the city to improve the conditions we live
in. I send so many emails to the managers and department heads that
they’ve started bouncing back. The city doesn’t see us, and they don’t
want to see us. To them, we’re just expenses and logistical issues. They
see us as problems, they see drug addicts, they see criminals. We’re not
those things. We’re people. We just want to be treated like decent human
beings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
