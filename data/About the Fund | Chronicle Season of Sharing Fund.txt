  About the Fund

Since 1986, the Chronicle Season of Sharing Fund has raised $113 million
to help thousands of Bay Area families. The Fund offers grants to help
families in crisis so they can pay for housing and emergency needs.
Through a network of more than 150 community service agencies, the Fund
works to identify families in need and provide short-term, critical
assistance grants.

Grant monies from the Fund can help families in any number of ways, such
as paying the rent so they can stay in their home, covering a security
deposit so they can transition out of a homeless shelter, or buying a
wheelchair or other essential medical equipment that they couldn’t
otherwise afford. In addition, the Chronicle Season of Sharing Fund
supports food banks and distributes $1 million each year to
assist individuals and families who might otherwise go hungry.

Over the last 30 years the Fund has been one of the largest donors to
Bay Area food banks, providing them with $19 million. All of the Fund’s
administrative expenses are covered by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr.
Fund and the San Francisco Chronicle. As a result, 100 percent of the
money raised by the Chronicle Season of Sharing Fund goes directly to
help the families and communities we serve.
