Homelessness is not a uniquely San Francisco problem. Other cities — New
York, Seattle, San Diego — have arguably worse homeless situations. But
people sleeping on the streets and in tent encampments has long been a
defining characteristic of San Francisco. In few other cities are the
deprivations of the homeless so painfully visible and the effort to
house people or provide adequate shelter seemingly so broken.

It is a national shame that in this country 564,708 people were homeless
on a given night in January 2015, according to the most recent U.S.
Housing and Urban Development report. Of that number, 206,286 were
people in families. About 15 percent — 83,170 — were “chronically
homeless” individuals. In San Francisco, according to the same report,
the homeless population was estimated at 6,775. Such numbers, of course,
represent an inexact estimate of one moment in time, but they give a
rough idea of the enormity and the fluidity of the problem.

In San Francisco, a city that exhibits so much pride in its values and
image, the inability to house and provide care for the thousands who
live among us without homes is a disgrace. For many visitors, the
overwhelming specter of homeless in public and some of the more menacing
manifestations — aggressive panhandling, mental instability, drug use,
filth — is an unexpected and unwelcome shock. For longtime residents, by
contrast, the daily display of human destitution can become something to
grow inured to, to almost no longer see in the settled routine of days.

In these pages, we have over the years extensively documented the
ongoing struggles the homeless face in San Francisco as well as the
political machinations that have aimed, with decidedly mixed results, to
either help, corral, shove aside or offer opportunities to this troubled
population. We have written that the measure of a city’s heart can be
taken in how well, or poorly, it cares for the most vulnerable of its
inhabitants. And on that scale, we, as a city, can do much better. We
are failing too often in this most basic measure of care and compassion,
and we are all impoverished by these failures.

Today, the San Francisco Examiner joins with more than 70 other local
media organizations as part of the SF Homeless Project, publishing
stories about homeless issues in the Bay Area. Some of us in the project
are focusing on offering solutions, others on detailing the confounding
complexities of the issue or highlighting new trends in the decades-long
crisis. No matter our individual editorial perspectives or concerns, it
is the hope of all of us in the project that the diversity and breadth
of dozens of news outlets working in concert on this one issue can have
an impact on our readers and viewers, on our policy makers and civic
leaders. We all speak, thankfully, with diverse and varied voices. But
today, we join together to amplify our work in the hopes that doing so
will make a difference.

Earlier this week, several local business leaders — in the tourism,
hotel and restaurant industries — met with the Examiner to say they are
fed up with The City turning a blind eye to worsening levels of crime
and lawlessness on our streets. They said they were hopeful The City’s
new Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, opening on
Friday, was a step in the right direction. They called on The City to
provide more mental health services, more police patrols and more
supportive housing. They were frustrated, they said, that existing laws
designed to provide safer streets were not being enforced. Such
conditions are bad for business, of course, they told us, but their
primary concern was how unacceptable it feels to see so many people
living exposed in extreme distress. Such frustration is a collective one
in The City; we all feel more must be done.

This problem has vexed generations of civic leaders and advocates, many
of whom have worked diligently with pure intentions to solve the
seemingly intractable problem of housing those without housing. At this
moment of tremendous prosperity for San Francisco, it is particularly
maddening to see such poverty and need. In the decades that The City has
targeted addressing homelessness as its most dire civic priority, the
number of homeless in this city has barely budged.

The City’s efforts to end homelessness have, up to now, not been worthy
of the crisis.

The premise of the SF Homeless Project is that, collectively, media
outlets shining a bright multi-angled light on the problem of
homelessness at this moment can compel change. We, as project
participants, felt it was time to say in one chorus — a collection of
multiple voices — that what has been tolerated up to now is no longer
tolerable. Our city is fundamentally impoverished by the poverty not
only of those living on the streets but also of the paltry response we
have, up to now, been able to muster.

There is, we realize, a degree of presumption in thinking that a
collection of journalists, by choosing a day to write stories, can
somehow affect this. But we believe in the transformative power of the
press to hold elected leaders accountable, galvanize public interest to
address social problems, and tell stories of the place in which we live.
We hope the SF Homeless Project — this day of focused attention, and our
collective ongoing coverage — lives up to that goal.
