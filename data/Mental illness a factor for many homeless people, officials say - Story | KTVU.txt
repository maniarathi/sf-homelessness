*SAN FRANCISCO (KTVU)* - Michael Ornelas, 40, has lived with mental
illness all of his adult life.

Diagnosed with anxiety panic disorder and severe depression as a
teenager, Ornelas reached his lowest point in 2012 while homeless and
living on the streets of San Francisco. He had already spent two years
without a permanent home and was near his breaking point.

          Homeless


    Mental illness a factor for many homeless people, officials say

Experts say mental illness is a key denominator for many in the homeless
population. A change in California law during the 1960s has made it
harder to get treatment for many mentally ill patients.

//

Ornelas, 40, checked into a psychiatric hospital and he says after five
days doctors told him they were going to release him.  He knew that
meant he’d be back living on the streets.

"The medication I was taking at the time made me really sleepy so I'm
not going to take it, which is why I'm going to end up back in here,” he
told his doctors. "And I'm going to be in the same position all over again."

For many who are both homeless and mentally ill, it’s a familiar story.
And professionals cite mental disorders as a key denominator for many
people who live on the street.

The city’s Homelessness Survey estimates that more than one-third of the
city’s 6,700 homeless people suffer from psychiatric conditions.  Many
of those patients end up at the Tom Waddell clinic in the city’s
Tenderloin District, which specializes in the treatment of the homeless.

Dr. Pamela Swedlow is one of the staff physicians who treat homeless
people with a wide range of mental issues, including schizophrenia,
severe depression and suicidal tendencies.

"Mental illness (is) different from other kinds of illness," Swedlow
said. "It's the illness itself that prevents people from knowing they
have something that could benefit from help and then doing something
about it."

Swedlow said the most she can do is to make a connection with a mentally
ill patient and hope the patient decides to receive treatment.  

"If people just don't want to take their medication, then it's a matter
of time and working with someone, trying to convince them that it's
really worth a try,” Swedlow said.

_*The 1960s was a turning point*_

A sea change happened in California in the late 1960s when California
closed more than half of its psychiatric hospitals and then-Gov. Ronald
Reagan signed a law preventing the mentally ill from being forced into
treatment except under the most extreme circumstances.

"People were released from the hospital without proper support in the
community. And then when you had new populations sprung up who needed
long-term care in a hospital setting, those beds were no longer
available," said Anne Fischer, who works with the National Alliance on
Mental Illness.

There are some new attempts to get patients with the most severe cases
of mental illness into treatment.

San Francisco adopted Laura’s Law late last year, an ordinance named for
Laura Wilcox, a Nevada County girl slain by a mentally ill man.

The law allows relatives of a mentally ill patient to petition a judge
to order treatment for a person who has not sought treatment on their
own. Since its adoption, 76 people in San Francisco have received
treatment under Laura’s Law, officials say.

But ultimately, the law does not legally require the mentally ill
patient to receive treatment; he or she can still refuse the help.

Former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown said the laws need to be revised
to give the courts more leeway.

“The standard now is they must be a danger to themselves or a danger to
other people, otherwise, you can't do anything about it," Brown said.
"We need to change that law and make it more appropriate for the
circumstances of individuals who will ultimately thank you for being of
assistance."

Michael Ornelas said his breakthrough came when he finally realized he
needed help and a case manager helped him get into a program.

"The pain, misery, loneliness, not having anything, that's what broke
through (and) my mind opened up," he said. 

Once he was off the streets, into treatment and back on medication, his
life changed dramatically.

He now owns an apartment, has a job, is engaged and has reconnected with
his teenage son.  He also mentors psychiatric patients at San Francisco
General Hospital through a program called Mentors on Discharge.

The program, run by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, allows him
to meet with patients and share his success story. He said he hopes the
patients are inspired to follow in his footsteps. The program just
started in San Francisco, but is based on a pilot program in Alameda
County, which organizers say has produced positive results.

Ornelas said many mentally ill patients feel like they are being judged
which can hinder their efforts to seek treatment. "There's so much
stigma around mental illness so we can open up a space and there's no
judgment there," he said. "It's something I wish I had because I didn't
have that."
