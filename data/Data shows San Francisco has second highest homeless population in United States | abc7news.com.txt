The number of people on the streets of San Francisco is nearly twice the
number in San Jose, and three times the number in Oakland. But
statistics go beyond the Bay Area. (KGO-TV)

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) --
ABC7 News is joining forces with more than 70 other local news agencies
for the San Francisco Homeless Project. It is a plea for city leaders to
do something about homelessness in the Bay Area's most densely populated
city.

San Francisco leads the Bay Area in homelessness. The number of people
on the streets of the city is nearly twice the number in San Jose, and
three times the number in Oakland. But statistics go beyond the Bay Area.

A graph shows San Francisco ranks second to New York in homelessness.
There are 795 people per 100,000 residents. New York has 887, followed
by Seattle with 487, and Philadelphia with 384.

Most of the people on the streets of San Francisco come from the city.
According to the city's homeless survey, 71 percent were actually living
in San Francisco when they lost their homes.

San Francisco continues to be one of the most expensive places to live
in the country. According to real estate site Zillow, part of the
problem is that San Francisco has failed to build enough housing to meet
the current demand, sending home prices and rents up.

"There's no easy answer, unfortunately, one thing that you can consider
is zoning laws," said Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell. "Making it
easier to actually build in a city that is highly zoned or highly
regulated, and San Francisco is certainly one of those cities."

Renters outnumber homeowners in San Francisco. According to Zillow, the
average renter in San Francisco spends 41 percent of their income on an
apartment, lives paycheck-to-paycheck, and saves nothing for an emergency.

And those numbers certainly don't bode well for the growing homeless
population. The number of street homeless has been about the same in the
last few years. However, the number of total homeless has gone up to
about 6,500.

ABC7 is proud to participate in the "SF Homeless Project" with more than
60 other media outlets. A letter of intent was released Monday
<http://abc7news.com/society/letter-of-intent-for-sf-homeless-project/1402500/>.
