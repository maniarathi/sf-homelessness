  Why San Francisco's Homeless Became A Problem In 1982

by Jay Barmann <http://sfist.com/author/Jay%20Barmann> in News
<http://sfist.com/news>	on Jun 27, 2016 2:30 pm

As part of the SF Homeless Project
<http://sfist.com/2016/06/27/sf_homeless_project_kicks_off_with.php>
today we have two good retrospective pieces with archival footage from
the early 1980's in San Francisco that trace the sudden visibility of
hundreds (or thousands) of homeless on the city's streets to the year
1982. The piece above from CBS 5's Wilson Walker
<http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/video/category/news-local-news/3421791-sfs-homeless-problem-how-did-we-get-here/>
explains how one central problem that led very directly to putting
people out on the street was the abrupt de-funding of public housing by
the federal government — which went from an annual budget of $16 billion
in 1979 to just $1 billion in 1983. (In this letter on the topic of
homelessness
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/letters-from-the-mayors/>,
former mayor Art Agnos quotes a figure of $32 billion as the onetime
affordable housing budget of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which Reagan cut to $8 billion.)

That all happened in the middle of a recession, with 1.5 million
Californians out of work and some 12 million unemployed nationwide, the
disappearance of scores of manufacturing jobs, and just as state-run
mental health facilities were shutting down and/or ceasing to commit
patients against their will. As KQED notes
<http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/06/27/to-have-and-have-not-a-look-back-at-the-early-days-of-the-bay-areas-homeless-problem>,
/Newsweek/ ran a headline calling the holiday season in 1982 "The
Hard-Luck Christmas of ’82" and in the 1983 documentary you can watch
below, they refer to a "Reaganville" in Berkeley — a homeless encampment
so named for the "Hoovervilles" of the Great Depression era.

So, the phenomenon of modern homelessness can be traced to broad-ranging
political decisions made in the 1960's and '70's by conservative leaders
like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and hit its most visible, early
zenith in 1982 and 1983. In San Francisco, as Agnos tells CBS 5 in the
piece above, it's then become the duty of each successive mayor to come
up with his own approach in order to elected, and virtually every year
we now have the conversation of whether it's morally just to criminalize
homelessness, shuffling them off one sidewalk and onto another in order
to make the public temporarily believe the issue is being handled, while
we remain chronically short on supportive housing or long-term solutions.

Also, as the discussion of homelessness continues this week, people
should bear in mind the falsehood that homelessness is a larger and more
terrible problem than it has ever been in San Francisco. This New York
Times piece from 1998
<http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/13/us/homelessness-tests-san-francisco-s-ideals.html>
quotes a figure from the Coalition on Homelessness saying that 16,000
people were living on the streets of SF at the time — nearly 10,000 more
than were counted in the most recent homeless census, though experts
argue about that count and say that there may be as many as 10,000
homeless here currently.
