  9 things the homeless need that you’ve never thought of

Dropping a quarter in a cup isn't the only way to help people facing
homelessness.

Homelessness is a crisis we all want to overcome – for our
unhoused neighbors, for our city, for ourselves, for our children and
their children. After spending a few months on the streets producing an
8-part series of short films exploring solutions to homelessness,
SF-style, this is what I learned.

*S**leep* – You know what going without it for a night feels
like. But the cumulative effect is torture. People need a safe place
to sleep to protect their mental and physical health.
 
*S**howers* – There are fewer than 10 public shower stalls per thousand
people in SF. Same with toilets. Enough said.
 
*A** closer look* – Laziness is rarely what lands people on the
street, rather it’s usually a significant traumatic event like the
loss of a job, health, a child, a parent, a safe home or a safety net.
 
*A** simple hello* – Few can imagine what it’s like
to be routinely ignored by almost everyone.  
 
*A** long term view* – People who have fallen so hard may need several
chances to get on a path to fulfill their potential as human beings.
 
*Secondary s**ervices* – Counseling, work experience, child care and
other services alongside housing give people the best chance of getting
off the street.
 
*A** home within* – That inner place of peace is just as important as
the physical houses.
 
*Your employer’**s taxes* – When profitable companies use loopholes,
they count on the poor to foot the bill of our government expenses.
 
*Your vote for affordable housing* – There are simply not enough places
for people to live here. End of story.

Micro-Documentaries has launched our first original film series — Let's

holiday spirit, we'd love for you to entertain a gift, which we in turn
will use as a gift to San Francisco.
