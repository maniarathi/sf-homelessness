Lava MaeLava Mae founder Doneice SandovalLava Mae <http://lavamae.org/>

"Welcome to the land of broken dreams," Doniece Sandoval’s cab driver
said to her over his shoulder as they entered San Francisco’s Tenderloin
neighborhood, the locus of the city’s homeless population and services.

During her more than six years in San Francisco, Sandoval had been
through that area hundreds of times, but the driver’s starkness rattled
her, and she looked with fresh eyes out at the street-weathered faces,
the bodies strewn on the sidewalk.

Not a single one of these people dreamed of being homeless when they
were little, she thought, flashing back to her own adolescence and the
close bonds she’d made while mentoring youth impacted by systemic
poverty. Where were the individuals she'd worked with now?  

Several months later, she heard a woman crying on the street about never
being clean again, and the roots of Sandoval’s idea started taking hold.
A well-timed hot shower can do a lot more than wash away physical dirt.
Meanwhile, San Francisco only had a tiny number of public stalls available.

"Hygiene brings dignity and that opens up opportunity," Sandoval says.


That was three years ago. Today, Sandoval runs a thriving nonprofit
called Lava Mae <http://lavamae.org/how-we-work/> that is revamping old
buses into private bathroom and shower stalls for the nearly
7,000 people in San Francisco experiencing homelessness.
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/overview/> 

Six days a week, Lava Mae’s two buses and one trailer roll up to
different spots throughout the city. Equipped with bathroom and shower
stalls that hook up to fire hydrants, they provide  20 minutes of
privacy, cleanliness, comfort, and "radical hospitality" to those who
need it.

"It’s about human connection and that unexpected level of care,"
Sandoval says.

When the Lava Mae team checks in its guests, they make a point to
remember names and make people feel welcomed and listened to. They want
bus visits to feel like a stay in the Ritz Carlton. "We offer that level
of service to people who are often so vulnerable, who have lost
everything, and who are mostly either invisible or scorned."

 

Lava Mae

A shower is by no means a fix for homelessness, however it can provide
an opportunity for individuals to feel valued while rejuvinating their
resilience.

Sandoval also realizes that the people she’s serving need a broad
spectrum of services. She has started organizing "Pop Up Care Villages"
that bring together volunteers and nonprofits in one place to provide
things like free haircuts, legal advice, and medical services.

 

 

 

Lava Mae

She wants to make them a monthly occurence. 

Since launching Lava Mae, Sandoval has also gotten questions from people
all around the world who want to bring mobile hygiene stations to their
own cities. Lava Mae is expanding San Jose and Los Angeles later this
year, and similar programs are cropping up elsewhere.

Sandoval has been working on getting an open-source toolkit onto Lava
Mae’s website walking through what it took her to get started and
encouraging other people to share their best practices.

Meanwhile, she wishes for more improvements to the way San Francisco
deals with the root causes of homelessness and rehabilitation.

"We need to do more of everything,” she says, particularly prevention.

She also feels like conversations around homelessness have gotten even
more polarized over her three years of work, with increasing frustration
and tension between socio-economic classes. The tech industry often
receiving the brunt of criticism. 

Lava Mae <http://lavamae.org/>

Lava Mae has received two grants from Google and worked closely with
volunteers from a number of tech companies, like Zendesk and Salesforce,
so she dismisses the "evil tech worker" trope.

For now, she plans to keep focusing on what she can do to improve the
daily lives of the people she’s serving while the city works on its own
policies, but she’s a cautious optimist.

"I'm going to hold out for the belief that things will get better.”

For now, that’s her dream.

Here's what the inside of a gutted Muni bus looks like before Lava Mae
renovates it.

It cost $75,000 to equip each one with two toilets and shower stalls.
Its refurbished trailer fits three stalls.
