SF opens new full-service shelter to get homeless off streets
1 / 13
Back to Gallery

Safe at last under his first roof in two years, 53-year-old Gene sat in
San Francisco’s second Navigation Center
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Navigation+Center%22>
homeless shelter, stared into the eyes of the mayor and those who run
the center, and summed up the sea change in his life in four words:

“Here, you can breathe,” he said.

Gene, who gave no last name and spoke so quietly he was almost
inaudible, didn’t mean drawing in air. He meant feeling safe after years
of vulnerability on the street, where one second of strayed attention
can get your teeth kicked in.

That feeling of safety, and of hope and new beginnings, is just what
Mayor Ed Lee
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Ed+Lee%22>
and the program managers who officially opened the city’s second
Navigation Center at 12th and Market streets Tuesday said they had in mind.

The city of San Francisco counted the number of homeless in 2015. Here
are some of the findings.

Media: Douglas Zimmerman

The 93-bed center, like its counterpart that opened in the Mission
District more than a year ago, is a one-stop complex where chronically
homeless people can be moved straight off the street with their
belongings and partners, then quickly routed into permanent housing. It
has more counselors than a traditional shelter, and it’s more welcoming.

As of early May, the 75-bed Mission Navigation Center had sheltered 468
people, and city officials said 84 percent had found permanent housing.
The head of Community Housing Partnership
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Community+Housing+Partnership%22>,
a supportive housing and counseling nonprofit running the new center in
the renovated Civic Center
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Civic+Center%22>
Hotel, says she is aiming for at least that same success rate.

“Homeless people coming off the street need a pathway, need a runway to
get back on track,” said Gail Gilman
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Gail+Gilman%22>,
executive director of the partnership. “That’s what this place is about.”

The Board of Supervisors
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Board+of+Supervisors%22>
voted this month to open five more Navigation Centers over the next two
years in addition to the Civic Center building. The challenge as they
ramp up will be finding enough housing into which to put the homeless
clients, in one of the nation’s tightest and costliest real-estate markets.

*Redesigning system*

On Tuesday, as the mayor unveiled the new center, the head of his
Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Department+of+Homelessness+and+Supportive+Housing%22>
said one of his foremost tasks will be squeezing housing out of every
space he can find.

“It’s not just about the two Navigation Centers or the five others that
will open,” said department head Jeff Kositsky
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Jeff+Kositsky%22>.
“It’s about redesigning the entire system” that serves homeless people
and finds residential opportunities.

Asked how challenging finding new housing will be, he replied: “Very.”

*Partly filled*

A few homeless people started moving into the Civic Center building over
the past couple of months as it was being renovated, so as of Tuesday’s
official opening there were already 55 people in its rooms. There are
about 40 more shelter rooms to be filled, though some will be used for
the case managers and counselors who will be helping the homeless people
stabilize their lives.

The center has 12 counselors and case managers in the building. They
will also be helping 48 permanent residents who were living in the hotel
before it was rehabilitated and were allowed to stay.

Gene moved in a week ago, and he and another client, Elaine, spoke with
the mayor and his team just before the opening announcement. They sat in
the spacious, brightly lit common room on the first floor, one of many
improvements over the sorry state of the residential hotel before the
nonprofit took it over. For years, the Civic Center Hotel was what Lee
politely called “a house of a lot of challenges” — a roiling den of drug
abuse, beatings and other crime.

*Clearing tent camps*

Kositsky asked Elaine, who is 58 and did not give a last name, what
advice she had as he tries to create more supportive housing and help
homeless people. She stared for a moment, then said: “Pray.”

Kositsky also said Tuesday that he is creating a team of outreach
counselors to move the inhabitants of tent encampments into shelters and
housing, and that it will be led by Jason Albertson
<http://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Jason+Albertson%22>,
a longtime outreach counselor and manager. The team will hit the
sidewalks next month and will coordinate with police and street
cleaners, Kositsky said.

Kositsky said the team “certainly won’t be criminalizing people,” but
will be aimed at making life safer and more healthy, not just for
campers but also the residents around them.

Tent life is “not safe for the people living in the encampments, not
healthy, not the humane way to treat people,” he said.

  * FORT ROSS, CA - FEBRUARY 10: Heavy surf slams against the rocks
    along the coastline near Salt Point State Park on February 10, 2016,
    near Fort Ross, California. Much of Southern California has entered
    a fifth year of drought, but the irrigation ponds and reservoirs in
    Sonoma County Wine Country are filled once again and the grapevines
    are expected to come alive this week due to recent warm weather.
