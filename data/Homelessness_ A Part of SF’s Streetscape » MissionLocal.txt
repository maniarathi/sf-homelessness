We do it all the time . We walk by the homeless people on the street,
sleeping or asking for money. The homeless people that I’ve met in
encampments would talk pretty easily to strangers, but those in the
commercial areas often seemed to be angry – and rightfully so.  They did
not want to talk with me, and made it very clear that they wanted to be
left alone.  So that is what we do, we leave them alone.
