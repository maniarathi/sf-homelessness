  1961: Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine


    This famous recording shows us the roots of Reagan’s policies (or
    lack thereof) on homelessness

Notorious for turning a blind eye to issues around
deinstitutionalization and low income housing — and an increasingly
visible homeless population in the 1980s — many argue that Ronald
Reagan’s cutbacks in social welfare and poverty policies would badly
exacerbate the problem of homelessness over the next three decades.

Here he is in 1961, years before he became governor of California:

This early LP recording was part of “Operation Coffee Cup” in the late
1950s and early 1960s, a stealth campaign conducted by the American
Medical Association in opposition to the Democrat’s plans to extend
social security to health insurance for the elderly.

“Now back in 1927 an American socialist,” Reagan says, “Norman Thomas
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Thomas>, six times candidate for
President on the Socialist Party ticket, said the American people would
never vote for socialism. But he said under the name of liberalism the
American people will adopt every fragment of the socialist program…
There are many ways in which our government has invaded the precincts of
private citizens, the method of earning a living… [T]his threat is with
us and is more imminent.

Cover of the 1961 LP.

“One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a
people has been by way of medicine. It’s very easy to disguise a medical
program as a humanitarian project.”

“…We can say right now that we want no further encroachment on these
individual liberties and freedoms. And at the moment, the key issue is,
we do not want socialized medicine.”
