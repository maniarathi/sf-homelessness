Officials may consider taking a new approach to helping chronic
alcoholic homeless people in San Francisco, by possibly providing a wet
house that may cut public costs and help improve lives at the same time.
(KGO-TV)

ByCarolyn Tyler <http://abc7news.com/about/newsteam/carolyn-tyler>
Tuesday, June 28, 2016
SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) --
This week ABC7 News is joining a Bay Area wide media campaign to put the
spotlight on homelessness in San Francisco and look for possible solutions.

*RELATED: ABC7 proud to participate in SF Homeless Project
<http://abc7news.com/society/letter-of-intent-for-sf-homeless-project/1402500/>*

ABC7 News reporter Carolyn Tyler visited Seattle, Washington where there
is about 3,000 homeless people living on the streets. Seattle has a
controversial approach to chronic alcoholics that some say could work in
San Francisco.

A building at 1811 Eastlake looks like any other apartment building in
Seattle, but there you'll find a program that's gained international
attention and it's commonly called a wet house. "This is a little white
wine, I'm going to down it right now and get it out of your face," one
man said.

*WATCH VIDEO:* *SF program provides housing, hope for homeless
<http://abc7news.com/news/sf-program-provides-housing-hope-for-homeless-/1404295/>*

The building opened in 2005, designed specifically for chronic
alcoholics who were living on the streets.

The county made a list of Seattle's heaviest users of medical services,
sobering centers and jails.

The top 75 moved in to individual apartments, like one place Lovella
Black Bear calls home. "You can drink in this building, but you can
drink safely and that is a good thing," she said.

She and the others have counseling, treatment and other services
available on site, but they don't have to attend.

Leading critics label this type of housing bunks for drunks. "We can
take that kind of approach, that moralistic approach of saying that if
you're going to get government support, you're going to have to agree to
these particular terms of the whole thing, and the result would be, that
we would not be succeeding with these people. They would still be out
there," Downtown Emergency Services Center Director Daniel Malone said.

Malone says many critics changed their tune after research published in
2009.

In the journal of the American Medical Association, it found this wet
house was actually saving tax payer dollars. "The average tenant in the
program was racking up about $80,000 worth of these public systems costs
in the year before moving in and the year after moving in it was about
cut in half," Malone said.

It's also improving lives. The tenants buy the booze with their welfare
checks, disability benefits or other income, and even though they have a
steady supply of alcohol, the research showed people like John Knudsen
often reduced their drinking. "I don't drink near as much as I used too
and as a matter of fact, I'm in recovery at this point as we speak.,"
Knudsen said.

Bevan Dufty, former director of San Francisco's homeless programs took
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and other officials on a tour of the Seattle
project a few years ago.

Dufty believes a wet house in San Francisco would have a measurable
impact. "I think if you opened 75 to 100 units of wet housing, I think
people in the city would feel a difference, see a difference," he said.

Jeff Kositsky is the director of San Francisco's newly established
department on homelessness. "I'm absolutely supportive of the idea of
having housing first. I'm supportive of the idea of harm reduction. This
is a great blend of those two concepts," he said.

But he wants to make sure what's apparently working in Seattle, is a
good fit for San Francisco.
