*SEATTLE (KTVU) *-- The city of Seattle is known for such icons as
flying salmon, the Space Needle, and ferries on Puget Sound. But now,
something else is becoming a fixture on the landscape of the Emerald
City: a growing number of homeless people.

Frank Parker Jr., a recent arrival to Seattle, was seen recently
strumming cords on his guitar for spare change near Pioneer Square, a
hot spot for tourists.

"There are a lot of homeless people here I've noticed," he said. During
his performances, some on-lookers put crumpled $1 bills into a cup on
the ground not far from his feet, at the corner of First Avenue and
Cherry Street.

    Seattle looks to public-private partnership to combat homelessness

The city of Seattle is known for such icons as flying salmon, the Space
Needle, and ferries on Puget Sound. But now, something else is becoming
a fixture on the landscape of the Emerald City: a growing number of
homeless people.

//

//

"There's a lot of homeless people everywhere," he said. "It doesn't
matter where you go. This world is full of homeless people. It's just
one of those things, man."

The Emerald City's shine has been dulled in recent years by encampments
of people unable to live anywhere but on the streets. Similar to the Bay
Area, it's a problem partially fueled by the tech boom.

"Homelessness has been on the rise," said Rachel Fyall, an associate
public policy professor at the University of Washington. "The mayor has
declared a state of emergency and over the past few years the homeless
rates have just been increasing in a disturbing fashion." 

Seattle -- much like the San Francisco Bay Area -- is almost a victim of
its own success. Seattle's high-tech boom has brought an influx of new
firms looking for a cheaper place to set up shop than the Bay Area.

That's led to rapid economic growth with well paid workers as a
dividend. But it's also brought one unintended consequence: an increase
in the number of homeless people. City statistics show 2015 was worse
than 2014 and 2016 is seeing a 19 percent increase over last year.

One possible remedy in Seattle: seeking help from some of the companies
partially blamed for contributing to the influx of homeless.

Marty Hartman is executive director of Mary's Place, a non-profit which
works to get the homeless off city streets. 

"Our families were outside," she said. "They were under bridges. They
were in doorways. And they were sleeping in their cars."

Hartman said that changed when Amazon partnered with the city to create
a stop-gap solution. The online retailer donated the use of one of its
brick-and-mortar buildings in downtown Seattle. The former Travelodge
Hotel on 8th Avenue is expected to be demolished in a year to
accommodate Amazon's massive office expansion.

Before the demolition, however, it's serving as home to a 63-room
shelter run being run by Mary's Place. Homeless people and their pets
can stay during the evenings and weekends instead of sleeping on the street.

Barry Jackson, suffering health problems, moved in after the death of
his spouse.

He's been living in one of the rooms with his 6-year-old daughter,
Mariah, who loves to pretend she's a chef, and his 17-month old son
Joey, who's just learning to walk.

"This is a true God-send," he said of the shelter as he struggled to
hold back tears. "I'm just grateful to be able to come daily and to have
a clean safe place for my little family and myself."

Hartman says 200 people use the shelter. And in addition to the
playroom, there's a laundry facility, a kitchen for breakfast and dinner
meals during the week, and a "Wish List" room, where Amazon shoppers can
donate supplies. Many of the guests perform light housekeeping chores to
earn points that can be redeemed at the Wish List room.

Shethy Smith does light vacuuming in the corridors on the first floor.
She says her family went from living in an apartment to living on the
streets after the family of four was severely sickened by the flu. She
said her husband's battle was the worst and lasted the longest, nearly
costing him his life.

"By the time he got out of the emergency room, the job was gone," she
said. "So no money, no job, no housing."

That forced the family to try living in their car and when that failed
the four ended up at Marty's Place.

"This is keeping your family together," Hartman said. "It's keeping them
safe. It's keeping them warm. It's keeping them alive and it's bringing
hope."

The shelter is living on borrowed time.

In a few months, the planned demolition of the building will force the
shelter to move to new quarters in the area. It's not a permanent
solution but experts believe this type of corporate-public partnership,
combined with the construction of more affordable housing can reduce the
number of homeless people.

"It's helpful as long as there are people who  . . . think that is their
best option," said professor Fyall.

Barry Jackson works in marketing and sales and he hopes to have a new
job, and home in the next two months. Shethy Smith and her husband have
come up with an energy drink, and plan to leave Mary's Place soon.

They all say this temporary shelter and creative use of old space saved
them from becoming fixtures on the streets.
