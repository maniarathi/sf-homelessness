jeff kositsky san franciscoSan Francisco Department of Homelessness &
Supportive Housing Director Jeff KositskyYouTube/San Francisco Super
Bowl 50 Host Committee <https://www.youtube.com/user/SFsuperbowlbid/about>

In May 2016, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced that Jeff Kositsky, a
long-time fixture in the city's non-profit sphere, would be the first
director of the city's brand-new Department of Homelessness and
Supportive Housing.

Kositsky has his work cut out for him: As of the city's last count in
2015, San Francisco had 6,686 homeless people, up from 6,436 in the
previous study done in 2013
<http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/overview/>.

Meanwhile, San Francisco is in the middle of a full-on housing crisis
<http://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-housing-crisis-history-2016-6>
— forcing many families into substandard living situations, while the
specter of eviction looms large
<http://www.businessinsider.com/r-longtime-black-san-francisco-church-faces-eviction-amid-gentrification-2016-2>. 

It's probably not a fair rap, but lots of San Franciscans pin the blame
on the city's booming tech industry, which has led to an influx of
young, well-paid workers. For the last several years, tensions between
tech and the people of the city have run high
<http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-sues-san-francisco-over-rental-laws-2016-6>. 

But Kositsky tells Business Insider that the tech scene have been strong
and consistent partners in San Francisco's fight against homelessness,
with tech companies, programmers, engineers, and executives all jumping
in to offer their time, talent, and, of course, cash.

"There are many ways these companies can help," Kositsky says.

It's help that Kositsky is more than happy to accept. In fact,
Kositsky says that he's taken a lot of inspiration from the city's tech
community as he works to uphold Mayor Lee's promise to house 8,000
people before his term ends in 2020.

That inspiration extends to things like building better software to
serve San Franciscans in need, which is where that talent comes in. But
it's also influencing Kositsky's philosophy — he says you might even see
the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing raise a round of
donations and grants like a startup might raise a round of investment
capital.

"As an individual, I've drawn inspiration from the energy I feel working
with people in the tech sector," Kositsky says. 


    Two-year lag

In his previous job as executive director of the San Francisco nonprofit
Hamilton Family Center
<http://www.businessinsider.com/google-twitter-salesforce-help-hamilton-fight-homelessness-in-san-francisco-2016-6>,
Kositsky earned a reputation for being a conduit between the tech sector
and public service — Hamilton has worked with companies like Google,
Twitter and Salesforce on education and housing initiatives. 

Those collaborations have helped Kositsky realize he could apply the
lessons of the tech industry to building software for public service. In
a lot of ways, they're solving the same problems.

"I don't think it's any different in the public sector and in the
private sector," Kositsky says. 

For instance, the statistics on San Francisco's  homeless population
cited above come from a study that San Francisco is required to do every
two years by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
It's better than nothing, but it's not exactly the real-time view into
customer habits enjoyed by, say, Uber
<http://www.businessinsider.com/mixpanel-predict-helps-uber-see-into-the-future-2015-11>.

"We had a two-year lag, even as we looked at data," Kositsky says.

That's a problem when you're trying to solve an ever-evolving problem
like homelessness. And so, Kositsky sees a huge opportunity to kill two
birds with one stone. One of his big projects is software that he calls
a "coordinated entry and assessment system," also known as a "navigation
system." 

The "navigation system" will be an iPad app, given to Department of
Homelessness and Supportive Housing workers, that lets clients fill out
one single form and immediately enroll in multiple benefit and
assistance programs.

"What services they get aren't going to be based on what line they got
in, but on the services they need," Kositsky says.

In other words, the department's clients don't have to sit in DMV-style
lines all day for each individual program. And Kositsky's team gets an
unprecedented look, in real time, into who's applying for help, where,
when, and which programs are most popular and helpful.


    Power and responsibility

As Kositsky's team works on the navigation system and other projects in
the works, he says that the tech industry has been generous with its time.

Certain unnamed tech companies have gone so far as to lend engineers for
a few hours or days to help the city vet new technologies and
contractors, to make sure they're making wise purchasing decisions, he
says.

Those same companies are helping advise on how best to engage with their
peers in the tech industry, which may well include a startup-like
fundraising process to fund the development of the navigation system
software.

But Kositsky wants to be clear: whatever tech companies have done to
contribute to the homeless problem, he doesn't take their support for
granted. "I don't feel like any particular sector should be held
responsible for solving any social problem," Kositsky says.

It's up to corporations and citizens alike to decide which issues they
care about, and support those causes in whatever ways they find to be
most appropriate. It's Kositsky's job to put donated resources to work
in the most efficient and logical ways possible, whether they come from
the tech industry, healthcare, financial, or whatever else.

The other thing Kositsky wants people to know is that despite the city's
historical struggles with the issue of homelessness, San Francisco is
taking big steps in tackling this crisis, not least with his own
appointment in this role. And while technology certainly isn't the whole
story there, it definitely has a role to play.

"People think that there's no hope and everything's bad, but that's not
the case," Kositsky says.
