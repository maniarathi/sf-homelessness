/5:30 p.m. — Doors Open & Networking
6:00 p.m. — Program Begins/
 
On June 29, more than 30 Bay Area media organizations, spanning radio,
print, online and television, will curate an unprecedented wave of
coverage about homelessness in San Francisco. The goal of the day will
be to report on the current challenges that the city faces, uncover
solutions and inspire action. Join us, and a panel of local policy
experts, housing providers and journalists, as we explore the potential
impact of this coordinated coverage by digging deep into the tough
problems that San Francisco needs to address while simultaneously
discussing the way forward. /Co-presented by HandUp <http://handup.org/>./
