  *What will you do differently tomorrow because of what you read today?*

Today, Bay Area publishers are flooding our news feeds with modern day
stories of /How The Other Half Lives/
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Other_Half_Lives>. While I’m
confident I’ll learn much about the current state of homelessness, I
struggle with how woefully unequipped I am individually to take action
on my new knowledge.

We live in a community that considers no technological challenge too
large to overcome, yet we ignore the very visceral challenges facing
those struggling right outside our windows. We develop self-driving cars
and rockets to Mars, but we haven’t cracked how to help the at least
9,000+
<http://sfist.com/2016/06/28/homelessness_coverage_recap_day_two.php>
homeless who live and die on our streets and in our shelters.

Fortunately, the Bay Area is blossoming with smart, impactful
non-profits dedicated to improving the lives of our homeless neighbors.
And they need our help. Whether you choose to open your wallet or donate
your time, these are a few areas where you can exercise your empathy:

  * *Housing:* San Francisco’s Housing First program
    <http://www.sfhip.org/index.php?module=promisepractice&controller=index&action=view&pid=3933>
    was created to place homeless community members in permanent
    housing, where they can begin to receive counseling and services to
    address the underlying causes of their homelessness. While
    well-intentioned, Housing First has been plagued by a lack of
    affordable housing
    <http://sfpublicpress.org/news/2014-10/promise-of-supportive-housing-for-homeless-faces-reality-of-short-supply>
    to go around. The SF Community Housing Partnership
    <http://www.chp-sf.org/> fills that gap: they provide properties and
    services that increase affordable housing and enable self-sufficiency.
  * *Hygiene*: Poor hygiene is one reason why temporary homelessness
    becomes chronic; it’s a significant barrier to finding work. LavaMae
    <http://lavamae.org/> provides mobile showers to the SF homeless
    population, among others, and provides a level of hospitality and
    service that aims to restore human dignity in its guests.
  * *Services*: Almost three quarters of the SF homeless population
    relies on some sort of government service as they work to improve
    their circumstances. Project Homelessness Connect
    <https://www.projecthomelessconnect.org/> attempts to make these
    much-needed services — from haircuts to prescription eyewear — 
    easier to obtain. Thanks to the generosity of thousands of
    volunteers, they’ve provided services to over 85,000 homeless and
    low-income San Franciscans so far this year.
  * *Youth:* Over 10% of the homeless population in San Francisco is
    under the age of 18. Most are living on the street rather than in a
    shelter, and half have expressed concerns about their safety. Larkin
    Street Youth Services <http://larkinstreetyouth.org/> aims to
    inspire youth to move beyond the street, and 3 out of 4 young people
    who complete their program do just that.

While there’s no silver bullet among them, these non-profits are doing
meaningful work and need our support the 364 days of the year when
homelessness is not the #1 headline.

here on Medium or elsewhere, consider using //The Heartstrings Project/
