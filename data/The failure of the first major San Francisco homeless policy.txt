  The failure of the first major San Francisco homeless policy


    Mayor Agnos cleared out Civic Center Plaza in 1990, helped no one,
    and doomed his career

Mayor Art Agnos’ homelessness policy of 1990, dubbed “Beyond Shelter
<https://archive.org/stream/beyondshelterhom1990sanf#page/n0/mode/2up>,”
attempted to push the city away from “Band-Aid” solutions towards a more
permanent affordable housing approach. But public impatience with the
growing number of homeless boiled over when Agnos refused to clear out
the homeless camping in front of City Hall — his stand being that he
wouldn’t force them to move until there was a viable place for them /to/
move/./

After mounting and vitriolic criticism, Agnos finally secured 300 beds
for the City Hall group, and cleared out the encampment. He was roundly
criticized for tolerating the camp, for waiting too long to act, for
separating homeless couples, and for the fact that “215 of the roughly
300 beds that the new shelters now have are already filled by other
homeless people, and they will have to be displaced,” as homeless
advocates at the time pointed out.

His political career never recovered.

The fateful plan.
